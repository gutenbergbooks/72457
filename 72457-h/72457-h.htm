  <h2 class='c002'>THE COMMERCIAL RESULTS OF A WAR WITH RUSSIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After the enjoyment of nearly forty
years of peace, during which two
generations of men, whose fate it was
to live in more troublous times, have
passed to their account, we are entering
upon a war which will inevitably
tax all the energies of the country to
conduct it to a successful and honourable
conclusion. The enemy against
whom our arms are directed is not
one whose prowess and power can
with safety be slighted. A colossal
empire possessed of vast resources,
wielded by a sovereign of indomitable
character and vast ambition, who has
for years been collecting strength for
a gigantic effort to sweep away every
barrier by which the realisation of
that ambition has been impeded, is
our opponent. The issue to him is
most momentous. It is to decide
whether he is hereafter to be a controlling
power in Europe and Asia,
to rule absolutely in the Baltic, to
hold the keys of the Euxine and the
Mediterranean, and to push his conquests
eastwards, until he clutches
Hindostan,—or to be driven back and
confined within the limits of the original
empire which Peter the Great bequeathed
to his successors. Such a
struggle will not be conducted by
Russia, without calling forth all the
vigour of her arm. An issue so far
beyond her contemplation as defeat
and extinction as a first-rate power
in the world, will not be yielded until
she has drained her last resources,
and exhausted every available means
of defence and procrastination. Russia
possesses too in this, the climax
of her fate and testing-point in her
aggressive career, a mighty source of
strength in the enthusiasm of her
people, whom she has taught to regard
the question at issue between
herself and Europe as a religious one,
and the war into which she has entered
as a crusade against “the infidel”
and his abettors. The result may be
seen in the personal popularity which
the Emperor enjoys, and the ready
devotion with which his efforts are
aided by the Christian portion of the
population of his empire.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the other hand, Great Britain
enters into the struggle with every
recognised prestige of success in her
favour. She has, as her active ally,
the greatest military nation in the
world, whose soldiers and sailors are
about, for the first time for many
centuries, to fight side by side against
a common enemy. Little as we are
disposed to decry the strength of that
navy which Russia, by her wonderful
energy, has succeeded in creating
during the past few years, it would
be absurd to compare it with the
magnificent fleets which England and
France combined have at present
floating in the waters of the Black
Sea, and about to sail for the Baltic.
A comparison of our monetary resources
with those of our opponent
would be still more absurd. Another
feature in our position as a maritime
country at present, is the vast facilities
which we possess, by means of
our mercantile ocean steamers, of
transporting any required number of
troops to the locality where their services
are required, with a rapidity and
comfort never dreamt of during the
last European war. A veteran of
our Peninsular Campaigns, witnessing
the splendid accommodation provided
in such noble vessels as the Oriental
Company’s steamer <em>Himalaya</em> at
Southampton, the Cunard Company’s
steamer <em>Cambria</em> at Kingston Harbour,
Dublin, and the same Company’s
steamer <em>Niagara</em> at Liverpool,
and acquainted with the fact
that each of these vessels was capable
of disembarking their freight of
armed men within five or six days of
their departure hence in any port of
the Mediterranean, must have been
struck by the marked difference between
such conveyances and the old
troop ships employed in former days.
Moreover, there is scarcely a limit to
the extent of this new element of our
power as a military nation. We enter,
too, upon the approaching struggle
with Russia backed by the
enthusiastic support of all classes of
our population. It is not regarded
with us as a religious war, or one into
the incentives to which religion enters
at all. It is scarcely regarded by the
mass as a war of interest. With that
sordid motive we cannot as a nation
be reproached. It is felt only that an
unjust aggression has been committed
by a powerful state upon a weak one;
that the tyranny of the act has been
aggravated by the gross breaches of
faith, the glaring hypocrisy, amounting
to blasphemy, and the unparalleled
atrocity, by which it has been followed
up; and that we should prove ourselves
recreant, and devoid of all
manhood, were we to stand tamely
by and see a gallant people, differing
though they do from us in religion,
overwhelmed by brute force, and exterminated
from the face of Europe by
such butcheries as Russia has shown
us, in the memorable example of Sinope,
that she is not ashamed to perpetrate
in the face of the civilised world,
and in the name of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is one consideration, however,
connected with the present warlike
temper of our population, which
cannot with safety be permitted to
escape remark. We have already
stated that two generations of men
have passed away since this country
was in actual war with an enemy in
Europe. The bulk of the present race
of Englishmen have never experienced
the inconveniences, and occasional
privations, which attend upon war
even in countries, like ours, which are
happily free from the affliction of having
an armed enemy to combat upon
its own soil. We believe most firmly
that we are not a degenerate people.
We see evidence of this in the ready
zeal with which large numbers of our
hardy and enterprising youth are
everywhere flocking to be enrolled
under the flag of their country, both
for land and sea service. We trust
that this feeling will endure, and that
we shall be found willing to bear up
cheerfully under any temporary sacrifices
which we shall be called upon to
make; but we cannot blind ourselves
to the fact that a great change has
taken place in our social condition, in
our traditionary instincts, in our pursuits,
and in our institutions, during
the forty years of peace which we
have enjoyed. We have become more
essentially a manufacturing and commercial
people. A larger number of
our population than formerly are dependent
for their daily bread upon the
profitable employment of capital in
our foreign trade. The more extensive
adaptation of machinery to manufacturing
processes of every kind has
led to the aggregation of large masses
of our population in particular districts;
and such masses, ignorant as
we have unfortunately allowed them
to grow up, are notoriously subject to
the incendiary persuasions of unprincipled
and bad men, and have been
sedulously taught that cheapness of
all the necessaries of life can only be
secured by unrestricted communication
with foreign countries. Moreover,
we have had a large infusion of
the democratic element into our constitution.
Our House of Commons
no longer represents the yeomanry
and the property classes of the country;
but, instead, must obey the dictates
of the shopkeeping and artisan
classes of our large towns. It is no
longer the same body of educated
English gentlemen, whose enduring
patriotism, during the last war, stood
firm against the clamours of the mobs
of London, Manchester, and other
large centres of population, and turned
a deaf ear to the persuasions of faction
within its own walls; but a mixed
assemblage of a totally opposite, or,
at all events, a materially changed
character, so far as regards a considerable
number of its members. We
have in it now a larger proportion of
the capitalist class—men suspected of
being rather more sensitively alive to
a rise or fall in the prices of funds,
stock, railway shares, &#38;c., than to
any gain or loss of national honour;
more wealthy manufacturers, who
would be disposed to regard the loss
of a fleet as a minor calamity, compared
with the loss of a profitable
market for their cottons, woollens, or
hardwares; and, lastly, more Irish
representatives of the Maynooth
priesthood, ready to sell their country,
or themselves, for a concession
to Rome, or a Government appointment.
The honourable member for
the West Riding—Mr Cobden—showed
a thorough appreciation of
the character and position of a portion
of the House, and of his own constituents,
when he wound up his
speech on the adjourned debate upon
the question of our relations with
Russia and Turkey, on the 20th ult.,
with these words, which deserve to be
remembered:—“He would take upon
himself all the unpopularity of opposing
this war; and, more than that,
<em>he would not give six months’ purchase
for the popularity of those who advocated
it on its present basis</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Under such circumstances it is material
to examine what is the amount
of interruption to the commerce of
the country, which may be assumed
as likely to occur, as the result of a
state of war with Russia. What, in
other words, is the amount and the
nature of the pressure, to which the
masses of our population may be
called upon to submit, to prepare
them for the purposes of those persons—happily
few in number at present—whose
voice is for peace at any
sacrifice of the national honour, and
any sacrifice of the sacred duties of
humanity? We shall perhaps be excused
if we examine first <em>the nature</em> of
the pressure which is relied upon by
such persons; and we cannot exemplify
this better than by a quotation
from the speech already referred to by
the same Mr Cobden—their first volunteer
champion in the expected agitation.
The honourable gentleman
remarked:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“He could not ignore the arguments by
which they were called upon by honourable
and right honourable gentlemen to
enter into a war with Russia. The first argument
was one which had been a dozen
times repeated, relative to the comparative
value of the trade of the two countries.
We were to go to war to prevent Russia
from possessing countries from which she
would exclude our commerce, as she did
from her own territory. That argument
was repeated by a noble lord, who told
the House how insignificant our trade
with Russia was, compared with that
with Turkey. Now, that opinion was
erroneous as well as dangerous, for we
had no pecuniary interest in going to
war. Our interests were all on the other
side, as he was prepared to show. The
official returns did not give him the
means of measuring the extent of our exports
to Russia, but he had applied to
some of the most eminent merchants in
the City, and he confessed he had been
astonished by the extent of our trade
with Russia. He used to be told that
our exports to Russia amounted to less
than £2,000,000. Now, Russia was still
under the Protectionist delusion, which
had also prevailed in this country in his
recollection. (A laugh.) Russia still
kept up her protective duties upon her
manufactures, but he would tell the
House what we imported from Russia,
and they might depend on it that whatever
we imported we paid for. (Hear,
hear.) He had estimated the imports
from Russia as of much greater value
than most people thought, and he was
under the impression that they might
amount to from £5,000,000 to £6,000,000
per annum. Now, here was a calculation
of our imports from Russia which he
had obtained from sources that might be
relied upon,—</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, last year our imports from Russia
were larger than usual, and another
house, taking an average year, had made
them £11,000,000. In that calculation,
the imports of wheat were taken at
£2,000,000 instead of £4,000,000, and
that made the difference. He was also
credibly informed that Russian produce
to the value of about £1,000,000 came
down the Vistula to the Prussian ports of
the Baltic, and was shipped thence to this
country; so that our imports from Russia
averaged about £12,000,000 sterling
per annum, and included among them
articles of primary importance to our
manufactures. How was machinery to
work, and how were locomotives to travel,
without tallow to grease their wheels?
(A laugh.) Look, too, at the imports
of linseed to the value of £1,300,000.
No persons were more interested than
honourable gentlemen opposite in the
reduction of the price of the food of
cattle. Then take the articles of flax and
hemp. There were districts in the West
Riding which would suffer very serious
injury and great distress if we should go
to war and cut off our intercourse with
Russia. (Hear.) Even with regard to
the article of Russian iron, which entered
into consumption at Sheffield, he was told
it would be hardly possible to manufacture
some of the finer descriptions of cutlery
if the supply of Russian iron were
interfered with.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall not here take the trouble
of criticising Mr Cobden’s figures, but
take them as they stand, although
they are exaggerated enough. His
argument is obviously, that we must
submit to any amount of aggression
which Russia may choose to make
upon neutral countries, and even
upon our own Indian possessions, because
that country supplies us yearly
with thirteen millions’ worth of raw
materials and food! The same was
the humiliating position which the
men of Tyre and Sidon, as recorded in
Scripture, occupied towards Herod,
when “they came of one accord to
him, and having made Blastus, the
king’s chamberlain, their friend, desired
peace, <em>because their country was
nourished by the king’s country</em>.”
How, asks Mr Cobden, is machinery
to work without tallow to grease the
wheels? We are to have an anti-war
cry from the farmers for the lack of
Russian linseed; the West Riding of
Yorkshire is to be stirred up into insurrection
by the want of flax and
hemp; and the fine cutlers of Sheffield
cannot get on without the £70,000
worth of iron which they import from
Russia! The main reliance of the
peace-at-any-price party, we have no
doubt, rests upon the probability of
high prices of food, and their hope of
producing in the minds of the masses
the impression that the cause of those
high prices is mainly the interruption
of our usual imports of grain from the
Russian ports of the Baltic and the
Black Sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is rather singular that it should
not have struck so astute a man as
Mr Cobden, that Russia is very likely
to feel the loss of so excellent a customer
as England appears to have
been to her, quite as much as we are
likely to feel the want of her tallow,
her flax and hemp, her linseed, or
even her wheat. The vendor of an
article is generally the party who feels
most aggrieved when his stock is permitted
to accumulate upon his shelves.
The Russian landowners cannot very
conveniently dispense with the annual
thirteen millions sterling which
they draw from this country. Mr
Cobden may depend upon it that, if
we want it, a portion of their growth
of staple articles will find its way to
this country, through intermediate
channels, although Russian ships no
longer gain the advantages derived
from its transport. The fact, however,
of our absolute dependence upon
Russia for these articles is too palpably
a bugbear, either of Mr Cobden’s
own creation, or palmed upon
him by his friends, the “eminent
merchants of the City,” to be worthy
of serious notice, did it not betray the
direction in which we are to look for
the agitation, by which that gentleman
and his friends hope to paralyse
the hands of Government during the
coming crisis of the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the effort to form a correct estimate
of the extent of interruption to
our commerce to be anticipated from
the existence of a state of war between
this country and Russia, we
must have, in the first place, reliable
facts to depend upon, instead of the
loose statements of Russian merchants,
who are, as a class, so <em>peculiarly</em>
connected with her as almost to be
liable to the imputation of having
Russian rather than British interests
nearest to their hearts. We have a
right also to look at the fact that, so
far at least as present appearances go,
Russia is likely to be isolated on
every side during the approaching
struggle, her principal seaports, both
in the Baltic and the Black Sea, to be
commanded by the united British and
French fleets; whilst that produce, by
the withholding of which she could
doubtless for a time, and to a certain
extent, inconvenience our manufacturers
and consumers, may find its
way to us either direct from Russian
ports in neutral vessels, or through
those neighbouring countries which
are likely to occupy a neutral position
in the quarrel. We have also to bear
in mind that, with respect to many
of the articles which we have lately
been taking so largely from Russia,
other sources of supply are open to
us. It is remarkable to observe the
effect produced by even temporarily
enhanced prices in this country in extending
the area on every side from
which foreign produce reaches us. A
few shillings per quarter on wheat,
for example, will attract it from the
far west States of America, from which
otherwise it would never have come,
owing to the inability of the grower
to afford the extra cost of transport.
All these considerations have to be
borne in mind; and although it will
perhaps have to be conceded that
somewhat enhanced prices may have
to be paid for some of the articles
with which Russia at present supplies
us, we think we shall be enabled to
show that the enhancement is not at
all likely to be such as to amount to a
calamity, or cause serious pressure
upon our people.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before proceeding further, it may be
desirable to explain the mode in which
our trade with Russia, both import
and export, is carried on. Russia is,
commercially, a poor country. The
description of her given by M‘Culloch,
in an early edition of his <cite>Dictionary of
Commerce</cite>, published two-and-twenty
years ago, is as appropriate and correct
as if it had been written yesterday,
notwithstanding the vast territorial
aggrandisement which has taken place
in the interim. Her nobles and great
landowners hold their property burdened
by the pressure of many mortgages;
and they are utterly unable
to bring their produce to market, or
to raise their crops at all, without the
advances of European capitalists.
These consist chiefly of a few English
Houses, who have branch establishments
at St Petersburg, Riga, and
Memel on the Baltic, and Odessa on
the Black Sea. The mode of operation
is the following. About the month
of October the cultivators and factors
from the interior visit those ports,
and receive advances on the produce
and crops to be delivered by them
ready for shipment at the opening of
the navigation; and it is stated that
the engagements made between these
parties and British capitalists have
rarely been broken. This process of
drawing advances goes on until May,
by which month there are large stocks
ready for shipment at all the ports, the
winter in many districts being the
most favourable for their transport.
The import trade is carried on in a similar
manner by foreign capital; long
credits, in many instances extending
to twelve months, being given to the
factors in the interior. A well-known
statistical writer, the editor of the
<cite>Economist</cite>, Mr John Wilson, in his publication
of the 25th ult., says, upon the
subject of the amount of British capital
thus embarked in Russia at the period
when her battalions crossed the
Pruth: “The most accurate calculations
which we have been able to make,
<em>with the assistance of persons largely engaged
in the trade</em>, shows that at that
moment the British capital in Russia,
and advanced to Russian subjects,
was at least £7,000,000, including the
sums for which Houses in this country
were under acceptance to Russia.”
We can perfectly believe this to have
been the fact, under such a system
of trading as that which we have described.
We can believe, too, that a
considerable number of British ships
and sailors were at the same time in
Russian ports, and would, in case we
had treated the occupation of Moldavia
and Wallachia by Russian
troops as a <i><span lang="la">casus belli</span></i>, very probably
have been laid under embargo. We
could sympathise with those “persons
largely engaged in the trade,” in rejoicing
that, as one effect of a temporising
policy, the whole of this
capital, these ships, and these sailors,
had been released from all danger of
loss or detention. But we cannot
bring ourselves to consider it <em>decent</em>
in a gentleman holding an important
office in the Government, whilst admitting,
as he does, that we have
been bamboozled by Russian diplomacy,
to point triumphantly to this
saving of “certain monies”—the property
of private individuals, who
made their ventures at their own risk
and for their own profit—as in any
sort balancing the loss of the national
honour, which has been incurred by
our tardiness in bringing decisive succour
to an oppressed ally. Ill-natured
people might suggest a suspicion
that Mincing Lane and Mark Lane
had been exercising too great an influence
in Downing Street. And the
public may hereafter ask of politicians,
who thus ground their defence against
the charges of infirmness of purpose
and blind credulity, or “connivance,”
as Mr Disraeli has, perhaps too correctly,
termed it, upon this alleged
saving of a few millions of the money
of private adventurers—Will it balance
the expenditure of the tens of
millions of the public money which
the prosecution of this war will probably
cost, and which might have
been saved by the adoption of a more
prompt and vigorous policy in the
first instance? Will it balance the
loss of life—will it support the widows
and orphans—will it lighten by one
feather the burden upon posterity,
which may be the result of this struggle?
It would be a miserable thing
should it have to be said of England,
that there was a period in her history
when she hesitated to strike a blow
in a just cause until she had taken
care that the offender had paid her
shopkeepers or her merchants their
debts! We pass over this part of the
subject, however, as scarcely belonging
to the question which we have
proposed to ourselves to discuss.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our imports from Russia, upon the
importance of which so much stress
has been laid, were in 1852 as given
below, from official documents. We
have ourselves appended the value of
the various items upon a very liberal
scale; and we may explain that we
select that year instead of 1853, for reasons
which we shall hereafter explain.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have taken for the above estimate
the prices which prevailed in
the first six months of 1852, after
which they were raised above an
average by peculiar circumstances.
The year selected, moreover, was one
of larger imports than usual of many
articles. For example, our imports
of Russian grain in 1852 amounted,
in round numbers, to £2,235,300
sterling, against only £952,924 in
1850. Yet we have less than nine
millions as the amount of this vaunted
import trade from Russia, the interruption
of which is to be fraught
with such serious consequences to our
internal peace, and to the “popularity”
of the liberal representatives of
our large towns.</p>

rather <i><span lang="fr">mal apropos</span></i> for those who

our supplies of produce from Russia
into the ground of an anti-war agitation,
we have succeeded in procuring
from that country during the past
year supplies unprecedented in quantity.

<p class='c009'>If mercantile opinions are at all to
be relied upon, these extra supplies
ought to have a tendency to bring
down prices, which the prospect of
war has enhanced beyond what existing
circumstances seem to warrant,
even presuming that we had no other
dependence than upon Russia for the
articles with which she has heretofore
supplied us. For example, we have paid
during the past year, if we take present
prices, for our imports of wheat alone
from Russia, about £6,470,000 sterling,
whereas, at the prices of the
early part of 1852, we should have
paid for the same quantity of wheat
just half the money. And at the present
moment, and since war has been
regarded as inevitable, we have had
a downward tendency in all our principal
markets. It has been discovered
that we hold more home-grown wheat
than was anticipated; and, with a
favourable seed-time and a propitious
spring, hopes are entertained that we
shall not in the present year be so dependent
upon the foreigner as we have
been during that which has passed.
Tallow also is an article for which we
have been lately paying the extravagant
prices of 62s. to 63s. per cwt.
In the early part of 1852, the article
was worth about 37s. 6d. for the St
Petersburg quality. No English grazier,
however, ever knew butcher’s
meat or fat at their present prices;
and a propitious year for the agriculturist
will most probably bring matters
to a more favourable state for the
consumer.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not, however, true that a state
of war with Russia can shut us out
from our supply of the produce of
that country. It will come to us from
her ports, unless we avail ourselves
of our right to blockade them strictly,
in the ships of neutral countries. A
portion of it—and no inconsiderable
portion—will reach us overland, Russia
herself being the greatest sufferer,
from the extra cost of transit. There
can be no doubt of every effort being
made by her great landowners to make
market of their produce, and convert
it at any sacrifice into money; for it
must be borne in mind that they are
at the present moment <em>minus</em> some
seven or eight millions sterling of
British and other money, usually advanced
upon the forthcoming crops.
We need scarcely point at the difficulty
in which this want must place
Russia in such a struggle as that in
which she is at present engaged.
The paper issues of her government
may for a time be forced upon her
slavish population as money. But
that population requires large imports
of tea, coffee, sugar, spices, fruits,
wines, and other foreign products;
and it is not difficult to predict that
there will be found few capitalists in
Europe or Asia, willing to accommodate
her with a loan wherewith to pay
even for these necessaries, much less
to feed her grasping ambition by an
advance of money for the purchase of
additional arms and military stores.
Moreover, we are not by any means
so absolutely dependent upon Russia
for many of the principal articles with
which she has heretofore supplied us,
as certain parties would wish us to
believe. We could have an almost
unlimited supply of flax and hemp
from our own colonies, if we chose to
encourage the cultivation of them
there. In the mean time, Egypt furnishes
us with the former article;
and Manilla supplies us with a very
superior quality of both. Belgium
and Prussia are also producers, and
with a little encouragement would no
doubt extend their cultivation. Our
own colonies, however, are our surest
dependence for a supply of these and
similar articles. An advance of seeds
and money to the extent of less than
one quarter of the sums which we
have been in the habit of advancing
to the Russian cultivator, would bring
forward to this country a supply of
the raw materials of flax and hemp,
which would be quite in time, with
our present stock, to relieve us from
any danger of deficiency for at least
a season to come. With respect to
tallow, we have a right to depend
upon America, both North and South,
for a supply. Australia can send us
an aid, at all events, to such supply;
and we may probably have next year
a larger quantity within our own resources.
With respect to seeds, we
shall be able to derive these from the
countries whence flax and hemp are
cultivated for our markets; and our
timber, derived at present from Russia,
we can certainly dispense with.
There is nothing valuable in Russian
timber except its applicability for the
masting and sparring of ships requiring
large growth; and, with our modern
method of splicing yards and
masts, we can do perfectly well with
the less tall timber of Norway and
Sweden.</p>

<p class='c009'>The real fact is, that the alleged
short supply of the raw materials to
be expected from Russia is a perfect
bugbear. We could dispense with
Russia as a country of supply, were
we to employ British capital to assist
our own colonists, and other countries,
to provide us with such supply. There
was once, however, a Russian Company;
and the trade seems to have
been conducted as a monopoly ever
since.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we must get rid of this strange
argument, that the value of the trade
with a country consists in the large
amount of indebtedness which we
contract with its dealers. We have
now to consider the relative value of
Russia and Turkey as <em>consumers</em> of
British manufactured goods and produce.
The following we find to have
been the value of British and Irish
produce and manufactures exported
to the two countries for the five years
from 1846 to 1850:—</p>

<p class='c016'>Turkey thus took from us in 1850
£1,658,908 in excess of Russia’s purchases,
having increased that excess
from £416,719 in 1846. The increased
imports of the former country amounted
in the five years to nearly a million
sterling, or 50 per cent, whilst the imports
of Russia fell off by £370,377,
or above 20 per cent. There is this
great difference, too, in the imports
from this country of Russia and
Turkey—The former takes from us
raw materials, which we do not produce
ourselves, deriving merely a
mercantile or brokerage profit upon
the supply; manufactured articles
which contain the smallest amount of
British labour; and machinery to aid
the progress of her population as our
rivals in manufacturing pursuits. The
latter takes our fully manufactured
and perfected fabrics. So far as our
cotton and woollen manufacturers are
concerned, Russia took in 1850—</p>

<p class='c016'>Our exports to Russia have certainly
increased in amount within the last
two years, although our customs’ reports
do not convey to us the full
truth as to their character. We have
been feeding that country with materials
of mischief. She has had not only
mill machinery, but the machinery of
war-steamers from us; but most likely
either Sir Charles Napier, or Admiral
Dundas, will be enabled to render us
a profitable account of the property
thus invested.</p>

<p class='c009'>But a comparison of our exports to
Russia and Turkey respectively does
not by any means meet the true facts
of our position. Within the past few
years we have been carrying on a vast
and increasing trade with those Asiatic
countries which draw their supplies of
merchandise from the various ports of
the Levant, and from the Adriatic.
Smyrna has become a commercial
station so important that we have at
this moment three lines of powerful
steamers running to it from the port
of Liverpool alone; and a very valuable
trade is also carried on by English
houses in the port of Trieste. Egypt,
too, is largely tributary to us commercially.
There is, in fact, no portion
of the world whose transactions with
Great Britain have expanded so greatly
in amount and value within the past
few years as those very countries which
Russia is seeking to grasp and bring
within her own control. Our “Greek
houses,” through whose agency the
bulk of this trade is carried on, are
now regarded throughout the manufacturing
districts as second to none
in the extent and importance of their
business; and, what is more, that
business must rapidly extend, as increased
facilities of communication are
provided from the shores of the Levant
and the Black Sea with the interior
countries of Asia. Notwithstanding
all the faults of the Turkish
character and rule, we are inclined to
believe that from the reign of the present
Sultan, Abdul Medjid, a vast
amelioration of the condition of her
people, and the cultivation by them
of increased dealings and friendships
with the more civilised communities
of Western Europe will take place.
Be these expectations, however, fulfilled
or not, we cannot afford to lose
such a trade as the following figures,
which we take from Mr Burns’ <cite>Commercial
Glance</cite>, show that we are at
present carrying on with Turkey in
the article of cotton goods alone:—</p>

</table>

<p class='c016'>These markets, in fact, have taken,
during the past year, one-sixteenth of
our entire exports of plain calicoes,
and one-eleventh of our exports of
printed and dyed calicoes, whilst her
imports of yarn—the article upon the
production of which in this country
the least amount of labour is expended—have
been comparatively insignificant.
The imports of cotton goods
into Russia are, on the contrary, almost
entirely confined to yarn for the
consumption of the Russian manufacturer.</p>

<p class='c009'>So far, therefore, as our export
trade is likely to be affected during
the coming struggle, we have manifestly
got by the hands a more valuable
customer than we are likely to
lose in Russia; and we cannot discover
in what way, with the means
at present at her disposal, she can
interrupt, or limit, that trade further
than by destroying for a time the consuming
power of those provinces of
Turkey east of the river Pruth, which
she has occupied with her troops. Our
shipowners and manufacturers may
lose for a time some portion of the
valuable trade with the population of
Wallachia and Moldavia which is carried
on through the ports of Galatz
and Ibrail upon the Danube. It will
probably, however, be one of the earliest
aims of the combined powers of
England and France to clear that
portion of Turkey of the presence of
the invader, and to maintain the long-established
inviolability of the two
eastern mouths of the Danube—the
St George’s and Sulina—as outlets for
her commerce with neutral countries.
The remainder of our trade with
Turkey must remain impervious to
the efforts of Russia, unless her fleet,
at present shut up in Sebastopol,
first achieve the exploit of destroying,
or capturing, the magnificent
navies which England and France
have assembled in the Black Sea, or
her Baltic fleet succeeds in forcing its
passage through the Cattegat or the
Sound, and in making its way to the
shores of the Mediterranean. Neither
of these contingencies can be regarded
as very likely to be realised by Russia
in the face of the superior power which
will shortly be arrayed against her.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is certainly the possibility
that our commerce with Turkey may
suffer to some extent through the
drain upon the resources of her population,
created by a necessarily large
war-expenditure. No material symptoms
of such suffering have occurred
thus far, notwithstanding she has
been for months past actually engaged
in hostilities, the preparation
for which must have been very costly.
Her imports of textile fabrics fell off
very little in 1853 from their amount
in former years; and even this may
in part be accounted for by the unsettled
prices, in this country, which have
resulted from strikes throughout our
manufacturing districts, and other
causes of an accidental or a purely
domestic character. Moreover, to balance
any such falling off in her ordinary
imports, Turkey will most probably
require from us large supplies
of stores, munitions of war, arms,
&#38;c., as well as of produce of various
kinds, to fill up the vacuum created by
the partial interruption of her own
foreign trade.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have a further guarantee of
commercial safety during this struggle,
unless it should assume new features,
in the fact that the commercial marine
of Russia is blocked up, like her
fleets, in the Baltic and the Black Sea.
There is not at this moment a single
Russian merchantman in the ports of
Great Britain or France—the few
vessels which were shut out from
their usual winter quarters having
been sold some time ago, to escape
the risk of seizure. She is thus without
the materials for inflicting the
annoyance upon our colonial and foreign
trade which she might have
possessed, could she have armed any
considerable portion of her mercantile
navy for privateering purposes. It
has been reported, indeed, that two
of her cruisers have been met with
somewhere in the neighbourhood of
the Pacific, and suggested that their
object may be to waylay and capture
some of our gold ships. But that the
report in question is not believed—and
that any serious interference with
our vessels engaged in the carrying
trade, to and from the various ports
of the world, is not feared by our
best informed capitalists—is evident
from the fact, that there has as yet
been no marked advance in the rates
of insurance upon such property. It
has been reported, too, that Russian
agents have been lately engaged in
the United States of America in negotiating
for the purchase, or building,
of large ships capable of being
converted into vessels of war. Be this
so, although we greatly doubt the fact.
We cannot be taken off our guard, in
the event of any such purchase being
made, or such conversion taking place.
Our fast-sailing ocean steamers will
bring us the necessary information
quite in time to enable us to take the
steps most proper for the occasion;
and whilst mentioning those noble
vessels, we must remark upon the important
change which the application
of steam to navigation will effect in
all future struggles between maritime
countries. We do not refer here to
the power which it gives of taking
fleets into action, or of making more
rapid sail to the localities where their
services are required, although the effect
of this power is incalculable in
value. We allude merely to the advantage
which we shall derive in such
struggles from the vastly increased
rapidity and regularity with which we
are at present supplied with information
of an enemy’s movements, from
all quarters of the world. We shall no
longer have to witness the spectacle
of rival fleets seeking each other in
vain—proceeding from sea to sea only
to discover that they have missed each
other on the way. Traversed as the
ocean is now in every direction by
fast-sailing steamers, there can be
little fear of such fleets, if their commanders
are really anxious for an engagement,
being unable to procure
tolerably accurate information of each
other’s whereabouts. We shall no
longer require the aid of powerful
fleets as convoys of our merchantmen,
in seas where it can be so readily
known that an enemy is not to be
met with; and, as another result, we
shall probably see an end put to the
injurious system of privateering. Few
parties will be found to risk life and
property in assaults upon the commerce
of a powerful maritime country,
with the certainty before them that
every movement which they make
must be so promptly made known,
and every offence which they commit
must bring down upon them such
speedy punishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is, however, one element of
commercial mischief which may make
itself felt during the coming struggle,
although such mischief, if it unfortunately
should occur, could not be attributed
properly to the mere fact of
the existence of a state of war. It
may, and very probably will, be proved
that we cannot carry on a free-trade
system, which involves the necessity
of providing for enlarged imports concurrently
with expensive military and
naval operations both in the north
and south of Europe, and possibly in
Asia as well, with a currency restricted
as ours is by the mistaken legislation
of 1844. Already the note of alarm
of this danger has been sounded from
a quarter whose authority cannot be
treated lightly on such a subject. Mr
William Brown, the eminent American
merchant, and member for South Lancashire,
emphatically warned her Majesty’s
Government, during the recent
debate on the Budget, of the probability,
and almost certainty, of a severe
monetary crisis as the consequence
of persistence in carrying out
in their full stringency the measures
passed, at the instigation of Sir Robert
Peel, in that and the following year.
But for the operation of those measures,
Mr Brown contended that the
calamity of 1847 would never have
occurred. The country, he says, was
paralysed by the effect which they
produced; and the seven or eight millions
sterling in bullion, held at the
time in the coffers of the Bank, “might
as well have been thrown into the sea,”
as retained there unproductive during
a period of pressure. Should the same
state of things occur again, therefore,
during the approaching struggle—should
the commerce and industry of
the country be prostrated, and the
government be rendered incapable of
prosecuting with the required energy
a just war, to which we are bound
alike by every consideration of national
honour, sound policy, and good
faith towards an oppressed ally—we
must not be told that the suffering
and degradation which will be brought
down upon our heads are the results
of a war expenditure merely, or have
been caused by any natural interruption
of our ordinary trading pursuits.
The true cause of the calamity, it must
become obvious to all the world, will
be our dogged maintenance of an impracticable
crotchet; and should the
nation submit to be thus thwarted
and fettered in its determination to
maintain its high prestige—should it
submit to sink down from its position
as a leading power,—we may with
reason be asked the question, “Of
what avail is your possession of
the noblest fleet which ever rode the
seas in ancient or in modern days—of
what avail is the possession of
the best-disciplined and bravest soldiers
which ever marched to battle—of
what avail is your vast mercantile
marine, your vast accumulations
of capital, your almost limitless
command over all the improved
appliances which modern science and
ingenuity have constructed for the
purposes of war, if you cannot resent
a national insult, or oppose the aggressions
of an enemy, without commercial
ruin, suspended industry, and
popular disaffection and outrage being
spread over the face of your whole
empire?” We hope, however, for
better things. We feel confident that
a high-minded and honourable people
will not submit to be thus stultified
and degraded in the eyes of the world.
We entertain, too, a reasonable hope
that the unpatriotic faction, who would
gladly involve the country in that degradation,
will not be favoured in their
unworthy efforts by the possession of
the instrumentality—a suffering and
dissatisfied working population—upon
which they calculate to insure success.
By the blessing of a bountiful Providence,
clothing our fields and those
of Western Europe and America with
luxuriant harvests, we may this year
be snatched from our position of dependence
upon the growth of an enemy’s
soil for the food of our people,
and be enabled to enter upon a period
of plenty and cheapness, instead of
that scarcity and high prices of all the
necessaries of life from which we have
been suffering during the past twelve
months—certainly without such suffering
being attributable to a state of
war, or to any but ordinary causes.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE PUPPETS OF ALL NATIONS.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The history of Puppets and their
shows may at first appear but a trivial
subject to fix the attention and occupy
the pen of a learned academician and
elegant writer. The very word history
may seem misapplied to a chronicle
of the pranks of Punchinello,
and of the contortions of fantoccini.
Puppet-shows! it may be said; troops
of tawdry figures, paraded from fair
to fair, to provoke the laughter of
children and the grin of rustics—is that
a theme for a bulky octavo at the
hands of so erudite and <i><span lang="fr">spirituel</span></i> an
author as M. Charles Magnin? Had
M. Magnin chosen to reply otherwise
than with perfect candour to anticipated
comments of this kind—the
comments of the superficial and
hastily-judging—he might easily have
done so by saying that, whilst studying
with a more important aim—for
that history of the stage of which he
has already published portions—he
found the wooden actors so constantly
thrusting themselves into the society
of their flesh-and-blood betters, so
continually intruding themselves, with
timber joints, invisible strings, and
piping voices, upon stages where
human players strutted, that, to be
quit of their importunity, he was fain
to shelve them in a volume. This,
however, is not the motive he alleges.
He boldly breasts the difficulty, and
stands up for the merits of his marionettes,
quite deserving, he maintains,
of a separate study and a special historian.
He denies that time can be
considered lost or lightly expended
which is passed in tracing the vicissitudes
of an amusement that, for three
thousand years, has been in favour
with two-thirds of the human race.
And he summons to his support an
imposing phalanx of great men—poets,
philosophers, dramatists, musicians—who
have interested themselves in
puppets, taken pleasure in their performances,
and even written for their
mimic theatre. He reminds his readers
how many pointed remarks and precious
lessons, apt comparisons and
graceful ideas, have been suggested by
such shows to the greatest writers of
all countries and ages, and heads the
list of his puppets’ patrons with the
names of Plato, Aristotle, Horace,
Marcus Aurelius, Petronius, in ancient
times; and with those of Shakespeare,
Cervantes, Ben Jonson, Molière,
Swift, Voltaire, and Goethe, amongst
the moderns; to say nothing of
Charles Nodier, Punchinello’s laureate,
the assiduous frequenter of Parisian
puppet-shows, who has devoted so
many playful and sparkling pages to
that favourite study of his literary
leisure. M. Magnin begins to be
alarmed at the shadows he has evoked.
Is it not presumption, he asks himself,
to enter a path upon which his
predecessors have been so numerous
and eminent? The subject, for whose
frivolity he lately almost apologised,
appears too elevated for his range
when he reviews the list of illustrious
names more or less connected with it,
when he recalls the innumerable
flowers of wit with which their fancy
has wreathed it. So he marks out
for himself a different track. Others
have played with the theme; he approaches
it in a graver spirit. “I am
not so impertinent,” he exclaims, “as
to seek <em>to put</em> (as the Greeks would
have said) <em>my foot in the dance of
those great geniuses</em>. Too well do I
see the folly of attempting to jingle,
after them, the bells of that bauble.”
Following the example of the learned
Jesuit, Mariantonio Lupi—who wrote
a valuable although a brief dissertation
on the Puppets of the Ancients—but
allotting to himself a much broader
canvass, M. Magnin purposes to write,
in all seriousness, sincerity, and simplicity,
a history of the “wooden
comedians,” not only of antiquity,
but of the middle ages, and of modern
times.</p>

<p class='c009'>A subject of far less intrinsic interest
than the one in question could not
fail to become attractive in the hands
of so agreeable and skilful a <i><span lang="fr">savant</span></i> as
M. Magnin. But it were a mistake
to suppose that the history of the
Puppet family, from Euripides’ days
to ours, has not a real and strong interest
of its own. The members of
that distinguished house have been
mixed up in innumerable matters into
which one would hardly have anticipated
their poking their wooden noses
and permanently blushing countenances.
They have been alternately
the tools of priestcraft and the mouthpiece
of popular feeling. Daring
<em>improvisatori</em>, in certain times and
countries, theirs was the only liberty
of speech, their voice the sole organ
of the people’s opposition to its rulers.
Their diminutive stature, the narrow
dimensions of their stage, the smallness
of their powers of speech, did
not always secure impunity to their
free discourse, which sometimes, as
their best friends must confess, degenerated
into license. So that we occasionally,
in the course of their history,
find the audacious dolls driven
into their boxes—with cords cut and
heads hanging—or at least compelled
to revise and chasten their dramatic
repertory. Sometimes decency and
morality rendered such rigour incumbent
upon the authorities; but its
motive was quite as frequently political.
It is curious to note with what
important events the Puppet family
have meddled, and what mighty personages
they have managed to offend.
At the present day, when the press
spreads far and wide the gist and
most salient points of a successful
play, in whatever European capital it
may be performed, allusions insulting
or irritating to friendly nations and
governments may be fair subject for
the censor’s scissors. It was only the
other day that a Russian official journal
expressed, in no measured terms,
its high indignation at the performance,
at a fourth-rate theatre on the
Paris boulevards, of a drama entitled
“The Cossacks,” in which those warriors
of the steppes are displayed to
great disadvantage. The circumstances
of the moment not being such as to
make the French government solicitous
to spare the feelings of the Czar,
the piece continued to be nightly
played, to the delight of shouting
audiences, and to the no small benefit
of the treasury of the <i><span lang="fr">Gaieté</span></i>. One
hundred and twenty-three years ago,
Russian susceptibility, it appears,
was held quite as easy to ruffle
as at the present day. In 1731, the
disgrace of Menschikoff was made
the subject of a sort of melodrama,
performed in several German towns
by the large English puppets of Titus
Maas, privileged comedian of the
court of Baden-Durlach. The curious
playbill of this performance ran as
follows: “With permission, &#38;c.,
there will be performed on an entirely
new theatre, and with good instrumental
music, a <cite><span lang="de">Haupt-und-Staatsaction</span></cite>,
recently composed and worthy
to be seen, which has for title—The
extraordinary vicissitudes of good and
bad fortune of Alexis Danielowitz,
prince Menzicoff, great favourite, cabinet
minister, and generalissimo of the
Czar of Moscow, Peter I., of glorious
memory, to-day a real Belisarius, precipitated
from the height of his greatness
into the most profound abyss of
misfortune; the whole with Jack-pudding,
a pieman, a pastrycook’s boy,
and amusing Siberian poachers.”
Titus Maas obtained leave to perform
this wonderful piece at Berlin, but it
was quickly stopped by order of Frederick-William
I.’s government, for fear
of offending Russia. In 1794 a number
of puppet-shows were closed in
Berlin—for offences against morality,
was the reason given, but more probably,
M. Magnin believes, because
the tone of their performances was
opposed to the views of the government.
In what way he does not mention,
but we may suppose it possible
that the <em>Puppenspieler</em> had got infected
with the revolutionary doctrines then
rampant in France. The Prussian
police still keeps a sharp eye on exhibitions
of this kind, which at Berlin
are restricted to the suburbs. In
France we find traces of a regular
censorship of the marionette theatres.
Thus, in the Soleinne collection of
manuscript plays is one entitled:
<em>The capture of a company of players
by a Tunis rover, in the month of
September 1840</em>. This piece, whose
name, as M. Magnin remarks, reads
more like the heading of a newspaper
paragraph than the title of a play, was
performed in 1741 at the fair of St
Germains, by the puppets of the celebrated
Nicolet, and annexed to it is a
permit of performance, bearing no less
a signature than that of Crébillon. It
is not improbable that the puppet-show
had fairly earned its subjection to a
censorship by the irreverence and
boldness with which it took the most
serious, important, and painful events
as subjects for its performances. In
1686, D’Harlay, then attorney-general
at the parliament of Paris, wrote
as follows to La Reynie, the lieutenant
of police:—“To M. de la Reynie,
councillor of the king in his council,
&#38;c. It is said this morning at the
palace, that the marionettes which
play at the fair of St Germain represent
the discomfiture of the Huguenots,
and as you will probably consider this
a very serious matter for marionettes,
I have thought it right, sir, to advise
you of it, that you may so act as in
your prudence shall seem fit.” It
does not appear what result this advice
had; but as the date of the note
is little more than three months later
than that of the edict of revocation,
when Louis XIV. was exulting in the
downfall of heresy in France, and
when those who still clung to Protestantism
were looked upon as hardened
sinners, no better than common malefactors,
it is quite probable La Reynie
thought it needless to interfere with
the puppet-scoffers at the Huguenots.
D’Harlay, it will be remembered,
was intimate with some of the chiefs
of the proscribed party, and a particular
friend of the Marquis de Ruvigny,
although he some years afterwards
betrayed, according to St Simon, the
trust that friend had reposed in him.
But we are wandering from our wooden
play-actors.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first two sections of M. Magnin’s
work, devoted to the puppets of
Antiquity and of the Middle Ages, are
far briefer, and upon the whole, less
interesting than the portion of his
volume allotted to those of modern
times. All those parts display extensive
reading and patient research.
The author commences by defining and
classing his marionettes. “Everybody
knows that marionettes are
small figures of wood, bone, ivory,
baked earth, or merely of linen, representing
real or fantastical beings, and
whose flexible joints obey the impulse
given to them by strings, wires, or
catgut, pulled by a skilful and invisible
hand.” He divides them into three
classes: hierarchical, aristocratic, and
popular. In ancient times and in the
middle ages, the first of these classes
was decidedly the most important and
influential. Auguries were obtained
and miracles wrought by its aid, indispensable
to priestly ambition and
to idolatrous or erroneous creeds, dependent
upon prodigies for support.
Even at the present day, and in highly
civilised countries, puppets of this
kind are not wholly in disrepute, nor
are the services of bleeding saints and
nodding madonnas uniformly declined
by the pastors of credulous flocks.
The practice is very ancient—if that
can give it respectability. The statue
of Jupiter Ammon, when carried in
procession on the shoulders of priests,
previously to uttering its oracles, indicated
to its bearers, by a motion of
its head, the road it wished them to
take. The golden statue of Apollo,
in the temple of Heliopolis, moved
when it had an oracle to deliver; and
if the priests delayed to raise it upon
their shoulders, it sweated and moved
again. When the high-priest consulted
it, it recoiled if it disapproved
of the proposed enterprise; but if it
approved, it pushed its bearers forward,
and drove them, as with reins.
M. Magnin quotes, from the writers of
antiquity, a host of instances of this
kind, in which machinery, quicksilver,
and the loadstone were evidently the
means employed. “In Etruria and
in Latium, where the sacerdotal genius
has at all times exercised such a
powerful influence, hierarchical art
has not failed to employ, to act upon
the popular imagination, sculpture
with springs.” The ancient idols of
Italy were of wood, like those of
Greece, coloured, richly dressed, and
very often capable of motion. At
Præneste the celebrated group of the
infants Jupiter and Juno, seated upon
the knees of Fortune, their nurse, appears
to have been movable. It
seems evident, from certain passages
in ancient writers, that the little god
indicated by a gesture the favourable
moment to consult the oracle. At
Rome, feasts were offered to the statues
of the gods, at which these did not
play so passive a part as might be
supposed. Religious imagination or
sacerdotal address aided their immobility.
Titus Livius, describing the
banquet celebrated at Rome in 573,
mentions the terror of the people and
senate on learning that the images
of the gods had averted their heads
from the dishes presented to them.
When we meet with these old tales
of statues invited to repasts, and
manifesting their good or bad will
by movements, we understand by
what amalgamation of antique recollections
and local legends was
formed, in the Spain of the middle
ages, the popular tale, so touching
and so dramatic, of the <i><span lang="es">Convidado
de Piedra</span></i>. Between these tricks of
the priests of Jupiter and Apollo, and
the devices resorted to by the Christian
priests of the middle ages, a close
coincidence is to be traced. M. Magnin
touches but cursorily on this
part of the subject, referring to the
crucifix said to have bowed its head in
approval of the decisions of the Council
of Trent, to the votive crucifix of Nicodemus,
which, according to popular
belief at Lucca, crossed the town on
foot to the cathedral, blessing the
astonished people on its passage, and
which, upon another occasion, gave
its foot to kiss to a poor minstrel—perhaps
himself a puppet-showman—and
mentioning as a positive and undoubted
fact the movement of the
head and eyes of the crucifix in the
monastery of Boxley in Kent, testified
to by old Lambarde in his Perambulations
of that county. It is to
be observed that these winking, walking,
and nodding images were not
always constructed with a view to
delude credulous Christians into belief
in miracles, but also for dramatic purposes,
with the object of exciting religious
enthusiasm by a representation
of the sufferings of the Redeemer
and the martyrs, and probably, at the
same time, to extract alms from the
purses of the faithful. When thus
employed, they may be said to form
the link between mechanical church
sculpture, used by priests for purposes
of imposture, and the player-puppets
of more modern times. It is the
point where the hierarchical and the
popular classes of puppets blend.
Scenes from the life and passion of
the Saviour were favourite subjects for
such representations; but incidents in
the lives of the Virgin and saints
were also frequently acted, both in
secular and monastic churches, and
that almost down to our own times,
notwithstanding canonical prohibitions.
“In a synod held at Orihuela,
a little Valencian bishopric, at
the commencement of the seventeenth
century, it was found necessary to
renew the orders against the admission
into churches of small images
(<i><span lang="fr">statuettes</span></i>) of the Virgin and female
saints, curled, painted, covered with
jewels, and dressed in silks, and resembling
courtezans.” The abuse,
nevertheless, continued; and we believe
there would be little difficulty in
authenticating instances of it in Spain
within the present century. That it
was an actual puppet-show which the
ecclesiastical authorities thus strove
to suppress, or at least to expel from
churches, is clearly proved by a passage
M. Magnin quotes from the proceedings
of the synod: “We forbid
the representation, in churches or
elsewhere, of the actions of Christ, of
those of the most holy Virgin, and
of the lives of the saints, by means of
those little movable figures vulgarly
called <i><span lang="es">titeres</span></i>.” This last word is the
exact Spanish equivalent to the
French marionettes and the English
puppet-show. It was a <i><span lang="es">titerero</span></i> who
fell in with Don Quixote at a Manchegan
hostelry, and exhibited before
him “the manner in which Señor
Don Gayferos accomplished the deliverance
of his spouse, Melisendra,”
and whose figures of paste were so
grievously mishandled by the chivalrous
defender of dames. And it may
further be remarked, as a sign of the
ancient alliance in Spain between the
church and the theatre, that an altarpiece
and the stage or theatre upon
which a puppet-show is exhibited are
both expressed, to the present day,
by the word <i><span lang="es">retablo</span></i>. To the <i><span lang="es">titeres</span></i>,
by no means the least diverting and
original of the European marionette
family, we shall hereafter come. The
precedence must be given to Italy,
the cradle and the paradise of puppets.</p>

<p class='c009'>The eccentric and learned physician
and mathematician, Jerome Cardan,
was the first modern writer who paid
serious and scientific attention to the
mechanism of marionettes. He refers
to them in two different works, and
in one of these, a sort of encyclopedia,
entitled <cite><span lang="la">de Varietate Rerum</span></cite>, when
speaking of the humbler branches of
mechanics, he expresses his surprise
at the marvels performed by two
Sicilians, by means of two wooden
figures which they worked between
them. “There was no sort of dance,”
he says, “that these figures were not
able to imitate, making the most surprising
gestures with feet and legs,
arms and head, the whole with such
variety of attitude, that I cannot, I
confess, understand the nature of the
ingenious mechanism, for there were
not several strings, sometimes slack
and sometimes tight, but only one to
each figure, and that was always at
full stretch. I have seen many other
figures set in motion by several strings,
alternately tight and slack, which is
nothing marvellous. I must further
say that it was a truly agreeable
spectacle to behold how the steps
and gestures of these dolls kept time
with the music.” Such variety and
precision of movement prevent the
possibility of confounding this exhibition
with that puppet-show of the
lowest class common in the streets at
the present day, where a Savoyard
boy makes a doll dance upon a board
by means of a string fastened to his
knee.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a> M. Magnin supposes that the
single string, always at full stretch,
was a little tube, through which passed
a number of small strings connected
with the interior of the puppet. A
similar plan is general in Italy at the
present day amongst the aristocracy
of the marionettes—those whose performances
are in regular theatres, and
not in wandering show-boxes. The
theatre and the mode of working of
out-of-door puppet-shows is the same
in most countries, and it appears more
than probable, from the authorities adduced
by M. Magnin, that the marionettes
of Greece and ancient Italy had
much the same sort of stage as that on
which the <i><span lang="it">pupazzi</span></i> of Italian towns,
the London Punch, and the Guignol
and Gringalet of Paris, are to the present
day exhibited; namely, a sort of
large sentry-box or little fortress,
called <i><span lang="it">castello</span></i> in Italy, <i><span lang="es">castillo</span></i> in Spain,
and <i><span lang="fr">castellet</span></i> in France. In Persia, in
Constantinople, in Cairo, the same form
prevails. In modern times the extent
of the stage has been diminished, and
the apparatus lightened, so as to admit
of theatre, scenery, actors, and
orchestra being carried long distances
by two men. Formerly, in Spain,
as we gather from Cervantes and
other authorities, a cart was necessary
to convey the theatrical baggage of a
<i><span lang="es">titerero</span></i>, which was on a larger scale
than at the present day, many more
figures appearing on the stage, and
the mode of working them being different
from that now in use in strolling
puppet-shows, where the usual
and very simple process is for the
showman to insert his fingers in the
sleeves of the actors, only half of
whose body is visible. Master Peter’s
show was of a much more elevated
style, and seems to have possessed
all the newest improvements;
as for instance, when the Moor
steals softly behind Melisendra and
prints a kiss in the very middle of
her lips, we are told that “she
spits, and wipes them with the
sleeves of her shift, lamenting aloud,
and tearing for anger her beautiful
hair.” If the Lady Melisendra really
did spit—and that the word was not
a figure of speech of Master Peter’s
boy, whose flippancy his master and
the Knight of the Rueful Countenance
had more than once to reprove—the
civilisation of Spanish puppets must
have been in a very forward state, for
we find M. Magnin recording, as a
novel triumph of puppet-mechanism,
similar achievements in Germany in
the present century. When Goethe’s
<cite>Faust</cite> gave a fresh vogue to the marionette
exhibition, from which he had
derived his first idea of the subject,
Geisselbrecht, a Viennese mechanician,
got up the piece with those docile
performers, under the title of
<cite>Doctor Faust</cite>, the great Necromancer,
in Five Acts, with songs, and performed
it at Frankfort, Vienna, and
at Weimar, Goethe’s residence. “He
strove to excel Dreher and Schütz
(other proprietors of marionettes) by
the mechanical perfection of his little
actors, whom he made raise and cast
down their eyes. He even made them
<em>cough</em> and <em>spit</em> very naturally, feats
which Casperle,<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a> as may be supposed,
performed as often as possible. M.
Von der Hagen, scoffing at this puerile
marvel, applied Schiller’s lines, from
<cite>Wallenstein’s Camp</cite>, to the Austrian
mechanician:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<span lang="de">Wie er räuspert und wie er spuckt</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">Das habt Ihr ihm glücklich abgeguckt;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">Aber sein Genie....</span>’”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As regards his puppets’ expectorating
accomplishments, Geisselbrecht
appears merely to have revived the
traditions handed down from the days
of Gines de Passamonte. But we are
again losing the thread of our discourse
amongst those of the countless
marionettes that glide, skip, and dance
over the pages of M. Magnin. Having
spoken in this paragraph of the
general form and fashion of the ambulant
puppet-show, and having in so
doing strayed from Italy into Germany
and Spain, we will go somewhat
farther, to look at the most compact
and portable of all exhibitions
of the kind. This is to be found in
China. There the peripatetic showman
elevates himself upon a small
platform, and puts on a sort of case
or sheath of blue cotton, tight at the
ankles, and widening as it approaches
the shoulders. Thus accoutred, he
looks like a statue in a bag. He then
places upon his shoulders a box in the
form of a theatre, which encloses his
head. His hands, concealed under
the dress of the puppets, present these
to the spectators, and make them act
at his will. The performance over,
he shuts up actors and sheath in the
box, and carries it away under his
arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>The higher class of marionettes,
that have permanent establishments
in all the towns of Italy and in various
other Continental countries, and a colony
of whom lately settled in London,
would surely feel a thrill of indignation
through every fibre and atom of
their composite bodies, were they to
hear themselves assimilated to the
hardy plebeian puppets that pitch
their tent in the gutter or by the
road-side, and jest for all comers on
the chance of coppers. Here you have
him at the street corner—Punch, the
ribald and the profligate, maltreating
his wife, teasing his dog, hanging the
hangman, and beating the devil himself.
Or, open this portfolio, containing
Pinelli’s charming collection of
Italian picturesque costumes. Here
is Pulcinella, with his black half-mask,
his tight white jerkin, his mitre-shaped
cap. What a group he has
gathered around him:—idle monks,
stately and beautiful Roman women,
swarthy and vigorous <i><span lang="it">Trasteverini</span></i>,
children on tiptoe with delight, a lingering
peasant, who has stopped his
ass to enjoy for a moment the fascinating
spectacle and pungent jokes.
Nor is the audience always of so
humble a description. Persons of rank
and education have frequently been
known to mingle with it; and tradition
relates that the celebrated Leone
Allacci, librarian of the Vatican under
Alexander VII., author of many great
theological works, and of the <i><span lang="es">Dramaturgia</span></i>,
went nightly for recreation to
the puppet-show. In social position,
however, the <i><span lang="es">al fresco</span></i> performers are
necessarily far inferior to the more
elegant and tender puppets who have
a settled habitation, a smart and spacious
stage, a fixed price, and who,
instead of having their master’s hands
rudely thrust under their petticoats,
are decorously and genteelly manœuvred
by means of springs and
wires. The difference is manifest: it
is Richardson’s booth to the Italian
Opera; the <i><span lang="fr">Funambules</span></i> to the <i><span lang="fr">Comédie
Française</span></i>. Moreover, the materials
of the marionette aristocracy are
very superior indeed to those of the
common out-of-door jokers. They are
by no means of the same clay or from
the same mould. They are not cut
out of a block, daubed with gaudy
paint, and dressed in coarse and tawdry
rags. M. Magnin lets us into the
secret of their structure and motions.
“Their head is usually of card-board;
their body and thighs are wooden,
their arms of cord; their extremities
(that is to say, their hands and their
legs) are of lead, or partially so, which
enables them to obey the slightest
impulse given them, without losing
their centre of gravity.” From the top
of their head issues a little iron rod,
by means of which they are easily
transported from one part of the stage
to another. To conceal this rod and
the movement of the threads from the
spectators, the plan was devised of
placing in front of the stage a sort of
screen, composed of very fine perpendicular
threads, drawn very tight,
which, blending with those that move
the puppets, deceive the most attentive
eye. By another still more ingenious
invention, all the strings, excepting
those of the arms, were made
to pass within the body and out at the
top of the head, where they were
assembled in a slender iron tube,
which served at the same time as the
rod to move the figures. A totally
different system was subsequently introduced
by Bartholomew Neri, a distinguished
painter and mechanician.
It was that of grooves, in which the
marionettes were fixed. Their movements
were directed by persons beneath
the stage, who also pulled their
strings. These various systems, sometimes
combined, have produced the
most astonishing results. One of our
countrymen, passing through Genoa in
1834, was taken to the marionette
theatre <i><span lang="it">delle Vigne</span></i>, and witnessed the
performance of a grand military drama,
<cite>The Siege of Antwerp</cite>, in which Marshal
Gerard and old General Chassé vied
with each other in sonorous phrases,
rolling eyes, and heroism. The fantoccini
of the <em>Fiando</em> theatre at Milan
are as celebrated and as much visited
by foreigners as the dome, the arch
of the Simplon, or the shrine of St
Charles. In 1823, a correspondent of
the <cite>Globe</cite> newspaper spoke of them
thus: “Such is the precision of movement
of these little actors, their bodies,
arms, head, all gesticulate with such
judgment, and in such perfect unison
with the sentiments expressed by the
voice, that, but for the dimensions, I
might have thought myself in the Rue
de Richelieu. Besides <cite>Nebuchadnezzar</cite>,
a classic tragedy, they performed
an anacreontic ballet. I wish
our opera-dancers, so proud of their
legs and arms, could see these wooden
dancers copy all their attitudes and
graces.” Dancing is a department
of their performances in which the
Italian marionettes excel. A French
author, Mr Jal, who published, nearly
twenty years ago, a lively narrative
of a ramble from Paris to Naples, was
wonder-struck by what he saw at the
<em>Fiando</em>. The grand romantic drama
in six tableaux, <cite>Prince Eugene of
Savoy at the Siege of Temeswar</cite>, which
composed the bulk of the evening’s
performance, astonished him much
less than the ballet between its acts.
“The dancing of these wooden Perrots
and Taglionis,” he says, “is truly
not to be imagined; horizontal dance,
side dance, vertical dance, every possible
dance, all the flourishes of feet
and legs that you admire at the opera,
are to be seen at the <em>Fiando</em> theatre;
and when the doll has danced her
dance, when she has been well applauded,
and the pit calls for her, she
comes out from the side scenes, bows,
puts her little hand on her heart, and
disappears only when she has completely
parodied the great singers and
the proud dancers of <cite><span lang="it">La Scala</span></cite>.” But
doubtless the greatest compliment
these doll-dancers ever received, was
the practical one paid them by the
Roman authorities, who compelled the
female marionettes to wear drawers!
The completeness of the illusion in
the case of these puppets suggested
some curious reflections to a clever
French critic, M. Peisse, with respect
to reality in painting, and the laws of
material illusion. Speaking of the
Roman <i><span lang="it">burattini</span></i>, “These,” he says,
“are little figures worked by a man
placed above the stage, which is arranged
exactly like that of our theatres.
For some minutes after the rising of
the curtain, the puppets preserve their
true dimensions, but soon they grow
larger to the eye, and in a short time
they have the appearance of real men.
The space in which they move, the
furniture, and all the surrounding
objects, being in exact proportion with
their stature, the illusion is perfect,
and is sustained so long as the eye
has no point of comparison. But if,
as sometimes happens, the hand of the
manager shows itself amongst the
little actors, it seems that of a giant....
If a man suddenly came
amongst the marionettes, he would
appear a Gargantua.” Another well-known
and esteemed French writer on
Italy, M. Beyle (Stendhal),<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a> tells of
the realisation of this last ingenious
supposition. He relates, that after
the performance (at the Palazzo
Fiano at Rome) of <cite><span lang="it">Cassandrino allievo
di un pittore</span></cite> (Cassandrino pupil of a
painter), a child coming upon the
stage to trim the lamps, two or three
strangers uttered a cry; they took
the child for a giant. In all the principal
towns of Italy through which he
passed, M. Beyle waited upon the
marionettes—now in theatres, then in
private houses—and the pages he devotes
to them are full of that fineness
of observation which characterised
his charming talent. We can hardly
do better than extract his first impressions.
“Yesterday, towards nine
o’clock,” he says, “I quitted those
magnificent saloons, adjacent to a
garden full of orange trees, which are
called the <em>Café Rospoli</em>. The <em>Fiano</em>
palace is just opposite. At the door
of a sort of cellar stood a man, exclaiming,
‘<i><span lang="it">Entrate, ô signori!</span></i> it is
about to begin!’ For the sum of
twenty-eight centimes (three-pence),
I was admitted to the little theatre.
The low price made me fear bad company
and fleas. I was soon reassured;
my neighbours were respectable citizens
of Rome. The Roman people is
perhaps in all Europe that which best
loves and seizes delicate and cutting
satire. The theatrical censors being
more rigid than at Paris, nothing can
be tamer than the comedies at the
theatre. Laughter has taken refuge
with the marionettes, whose performances
are in great measure extemporaneous.
I passed a very agreeable
evening at the Fiano palace; the
stage on which the actors paraded
their small persons was some ten feet
broad and four high. The decorations
were excellent, and carefully adapted
to actors twelve inches in height.”
The pet character with the Romans
is Cassandrino, an elderly gentleman
of fifty-five or sixty years of age,
fresh, active, dandified, well powdered,
well dressed, and well got up, with
excellent manners, and much knowledge
of the world, whose only failing
is, that he falls in love with all the
women he meets. “It must be owned,”
says M. Beyle, “that the character is
not badly devised in a country governed
by an oligarchical court composed
of bachelors, and where the
power is in the hands of old age.” I
need hardly say that Cassandrino, although
a churchman, is not bound by
monastic rules—is in fact a layman—but
I would wager that there is not a
spectator who does not invest him in
imagination with a cardinal’s red cap,
or at least with the violet stockings of
a <i><span lang="it">monsignore</span></i>. The <i><span lang="it">monsignori</span></i> are,
it is well known, the young men of
the papal court; it is the place that
leads to all others. Rome is full of
<i><span lang="it">monsignori</span></i> of Cassandrino’s age, who
have their fortune still to make, and
who seek amusement whilst waiting
for the cardinal’s hat. Cassandrino
is the hero of innumerable little plays.
His susceptible heart continually
leads him into scrapes. Disguised as
a young man, he goes to take lessons
of a painter, with whose sister he is
in love, is detected by the lady’s aunt
whom he had formerly courted, escapes
from her into the studio, is roughly
treated by the pupils, threatened with
a dagger’s point by the painter, and
at last, to avoid scandal, which he
fears more than the poniard, abandons
all hope of the red hat, and consents
to marry the aunt. In another piece,
tired of the monotony of his solitary
home, he makes a journey to Civita
Vecchia, and meets with all manner
of ludicrous mishaps; and in a third,
entitled <cite><span lang="it">Cassandrino dilettante e impresario</span></cite>,
his too great love of music
and the fair sex gets him into quarrels
with <i><span lang="it">tenori</span></i> and <i><span lang="it">bassi</span></i>, and especially
with the <i><span lang="it">prima donna</span></i> whom he
courts, and with the <i><span lang="it">maestro</span></i> who is
his rival. This <i><span lang="it">maestro</span></i> is in the prime
of youth; he has light hair and blue
eyes, he loves pleasure and good cheer,
his wit is yet more seductive than his
person. All these qualities, and the
very style of his dress, remind the
audience of one of the few great men
modern Italy has produced. There
is a burst of applause; they recognise
and greet Rossini.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the performances of marionettes
in the houses of the Italian nobility
and middle classes, it is naturally
much less easy to obtain details than
of those given in public. It is generally
understood, however, that the
private puppets are far from prudish,
and allow themselves tolerable license
in respect of politics. At Florence, at
the house of a rich merchant, a party
was assembled to witness the performance
of a company of marionettes.
M. Beyle was there. “The theatre
was a charming toy, only five feet
wide, and which, nevertheless, was an
exact model of a large theatre. Before
the play began, the lights in the
apartment were extinguished. A
company of twenty-four marionettes,
eight inches in height, with leaden
legs, and which had cost a sequin apiece,
performed a <em>rather free</em> comedy,
abridged from Machiavelli’s <cite>Mandragora</cite>.”
At Naples the performance
was satirical, and its hero a secretary
of state. In pieces of this kind, there
is generally a speaker for every puppet;
and as it often happens that the
speakers are personally acquainted
with the voice, ideas, and peculiarities
of the persons intended to be caricatured,
great perfection and point is
thus given to the performance.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the passion of the Italians
for marionettes is found to be so
strong, so general, so persevering,
and, we may add, so refined and ingenious,
it is not to be wondered at
that most other European countries
are largely indebted to Italy for their
progress, improvement, and, in some
cases, almost for the first rudiments
of this minor branch of the drama.
Even the Spain of the Middle Ages,
in most things so original and self-relying,
was under some obligations
to Italy in this respect. The first
name of any mark which presents
itself to the student of the history of
Spanish puppet-shows is that of a
skilful mathematician of Cremona,
Giovanni Torriani, surnamed Gianello,
of whom the learned critic Covarrubias
speaks as “a second Archimedes;”
adding, that this illustrious
foreigner brought <i><span lang="es">titeres</span></i> to great perfection.
That so distinguished a man
should have wasted his time on such
frivolities requires some explanation.
The Emperor Charles V.’s love of
curious mechanism induced many of
the first mechanicians of Germany
and Italy to apply themselves to the
production of extraordinary automatons.
Writers have spoken of an artificial
eagle which flew to meet him
on his entrance into Nuremberg, and
of a wonderful iron fly, presented to
him by Jean de Montroyal, which,
took wing of itself, described circles
in the air, and then settled on his arm—marvels
of science which other authors
have treated as mere fables.
Gianello won the emperor’s favour by
the construction of an admirable clock,
followed him to Spain, and passed two
years with him in his monastic retreat,
striving, by ingenious inventions,
to raise the spirits of his melancholy
patron, depressed by unwonted
inactivity. “Charles V.,”
says Flaminio Strada, historian of the
war in Flanders, “busied himself, in
the solitude of the cloisters of St Just,
with the construction of clocks. He
had for his master in that art Gianello
Torriani, the Archimedes of that time,
who daily invented new mechanisms
to occupy the mind of Charles, eager
and curious of all those things. Often,
after dinner, Gianello displayed upon
the prince’s table little figures of horses
and armed men. There were some
that beat the drum, others that sounded
the trumpet; some were seen advancing
against each other at a gallop,
like enemies, and assailing each other
with lances. Sometimes the ingenious
mechanician let loose in the room
small wooden birds, which flew in all
directions, and which were constructed
with such marvellous artifice that
one day the superior of the convent,
chancing to be present, appeared to
fear that there was magic in the matter.”
The attention of Charles V.,
even in the decline of his genius, was
not, however, wholly engrossed by
such toys as these. He and Torriani
discussed and solved more useful and
more serious problems—one, amongst
others, which Gianello realised after
the prince’s death, and which consisted
in raising the waters of the Tagus
to the heights of Toledo. The improvements
introduced by the skilful
mechanician of Cremona into the construction
of marionettes were soon
adopted by the <i><span lang="es">titereros</span></i>. Puppets
were already a common amusement
in Spain, and had right of station on
all public places, and at all fairs, and
entrance into most churches. It is to
be observed, that Italian influence
can be traced in the Peninsula only
in the material and mechanical departments
of the marionette theatres.
The characters and the subjects of the
plays have always been strictly national,
notwithstanding that, from the
beginning of the seventeenth century
down to the commencement of the
nineteenth—and probably even at the
present day—the exhibitors of these
shows were principally foreigners, including
many gypsies. Punchinello
succeeded in getting naturalised under
the name of Don Cristoval Pulichinela;
but he does not appear ever to
have played a prominent part, and
probably was rather a sort of supernumerary
to the show, like Master
Peter’s ape. Occupation was perhaps
hard to find for him in the class of
pieces preferred by Spanish taste.
The nature of these it is not difficult
to conjecture. Spain, superstitious,
chivalrous, and semi-Moorish, hastened
to equip its puppets in knightly
harness and priestly robes. “Moors,
knights, giants, enchanters, the conquerors
of the Indies, the characters
of the Old and the New Testament,
and especially saints and hermits,
are,” says M. Magnin, “the usual
actors in these shows. The <i><span lang="es">titeres</span></i> so
frequently wear monkish garb, especially
in Portugal, that the circumstance
has had an influence on their
name in this country, where they are
more often called <em>bonifrates</em> than <i><span lang="es">titeres</span></i>.
The composition of <em>bonifrate</em>
(although the word is old, perhaps
older than <i><span lang="es">titere</span></i>) indicates an Italian
origin.” Legends of saints and the
book of ballads (<i><span lang="es">Romancero</span></i>) supplied
most of the subjects of the plays performed
by Spanish puppets. Of this
we have an example in the drama
selected by Cervantes for performance
by Master Peter’s <i><span lang="es">titeres</span></i> before Don
Quixote. In the course of his researches,
M. Magnin was surprised to
find (although he ought, perhaps, to
have expected it) that bull-fights have
had their turn of popularity on the
boards of the Spanish puppet-show.
He traces this in a curious old <em>picaresque</em>
romance, the memoirs of the
<i><span lang="es">picara Justina</span></i>. This adventurous heroine
gives sundry particulars of the
life of her great-grandfather, who had
kept a theatre of <i><span lang="es">titeres</span></i> at Seville, and
who put such smart discourse into the
mouths of his actors that, to hear him,
the women who sold fruit and chestnuts
and <i><span lang="es">turrones</span></i> (cakes of almonds
and honey, still in use in Spain) quitted
their goods and their customers,
leaving their hat or their <i><span lang="fr">brasero</span></i> (pan
of hot embers) to keep shop. The
popular manager was unfortunately
of irregular habits, and expended his
substance in riotous living. His money
went, his mules, his puppets—the very
boards of his theatre were sold, and
his health left him with his worldly
goods, so that he became the inmate
of an hospital. When upon the eve
of giving up the ghost, his granddaughter
relates, he lost his senses,
and became subject to such furious
fits of madness, that one day he imagined
himself to be a puppet-show
bull (<i><span lang="es">un toro de titeres</span></i>), and that he
was to fight a stone cross which stood
in the court of the hospital. Accordingly,
he attacked it, crying out, “<i><span lang="es">Ah
perra! que te ageno!</span></i>” (words of defiance),
and fell dead. The sister of
charity, a good simple woman, seeing
this, exclaimed, “Oh the thrice happy
man! he has died at the foot of
the cross, and whilst invoking it!”
At a recent date (1808), a French
<i><span lang="fr">savant</span></i>, travelling in Spain, went to
the puppet theatre at Valencia. <cite>The
Death of Seneca</cite> was the title of the
piece performed. In presence of the
audience, the celebrated philosopher,
the pride of Cordova, ended historically
by opening his veins in a bath.
The streams of blood that flowed from
his arms were simulated cleverly
enough by the movement of a red
ribbon. An unexpected miracle, less
historical than the mode of death,
wound up the drama. Amidst the
noise of fireworks, the pagan sage was
taken up into heaven in a <em>glory</em>, pronouncing,
as he ascended, the confession
of his faith in Jesus Christ, to
the perfect satisfaction of the audience.
The smell of powder must have been
a novelty to Seneca’s nostrils; but
doubtless the rockets contributed
greatly to the general effect of the
scene, and Spain, the country of anomalies,
is not to be disconcerted by an
anachronism.</p>

<p class='c009'>Into whatever country we follow
the footsteps of the numerous and
motley family of the Puppets, we find
that, however exotic their habits may
be on their first arrival in the land,
they speedily become a reflex of the
peculiar genius, tastes, and characteristics
of its people. Thus in Italy,
the land of song and dance, of strict
theatrical censors, and despotic governments,
we find the <i><span lang="it">burattini</span></i> dealing in
sharp but polished jests at the expense
of their rulers, excelling in the ballet,
and performing Rossini’s operas, without
suppressions or curtailment, with
an orchestra of five or six instruments
and singers behind the scenes. The
Spanish <i><span lang="es">titere</span></i> couches his lance and
rides forth to meet the Moor and
rescue captive maidens, marches with
Cortes to the conquest of Montezuma’s
capital, or enacts, with more or less
decorum, a moving incident from Holy
Writ. In the <i><span lang="de">Jokken</span></i> and <i><span lang="de">Puppen</span></i> of
Germany we recognise the metaphysical
and fantastical tendencies of that
country, its broad and rather heavy
humour, its quaint superstitions, domestic
sprites, and enchanted bullets.
And in France, where puppet-shows
were early cherished, and encouraged
by the aristocracy as well as by the
people, we need not wonder to find
them elegant, witty, and frivolous—modelling
themselves, in fact, upon
their patrons. M. Magnin dwells
long upon the puppets of his native
land, which possess, however, less
character and strongly marked originality
than those of some of the other
countries he discourses of. It is here
he first traces the etymology of the word
<i><span lang="fr">marionette</span></i>—unmistakably French,
although it has been of late years
adopted in Germany and England.
He considers it to be one of the
numerous affectionate diminutives of
the name of Marie, which crept into
the French language in its infancy,
and which soon came to be applied to
those little images of the Virgin that
were exhibited, gaily dressed and
tinsel bedecked, to the adoration of
the devout. In a pastoral poem of
the 13th century, he finds the pretty
name of Marionette applied by her
lover to a young girl called Marion.
“Several streets of old Paris, in which
were sold or exposed images of the
Virgin and saints, were called, some
<i><span lang="fr">Rues des Marmouzets</span></i> (there are still
two streets of this name in Paris),
others <i><span lang="fr">Rues des Mariettes</span></i>, and somewhat
later, <i><span lang="fr">Rues des Marionettes</span></i>. As
irony makes its way everywhere, the
amiable or religious sense of the words
<i><span lang="fr">Marotte</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">Mariotte</span></i>, and <i><span lang="fr">Marionette</span></i>, was
soon exchanged for a jesting and profane
one. In the 15th century there
was sung, in the streets and taverns,
an unchaste ditty called the <cite><span lang="fr">Chant
Marionnette</span></cite>. The bauble of a licensed
fool was called, and is still called,
<i><span lang="fr">marotte</span></i>; ‘by reason,’ says Ménage,
‘of the head of a marionette—that is
to say, of a little girl’—which surmounts
it; and at last mountebanks irreverently
called their wooden actors and
actresses <em>marmouzets</em> and <em>mariottes</em>.
At the end of the 16th century and
commencement of the 17th, several
Protestant or sceptical writers were
well pleased to confound, with an
intention of mockery, the religious
and the profane sense of the words
<em>marmouzets</em> and <i><span lang="fr">marionettes</span></i>. Henry
Estienne, inveighing, in his <cite><span lang="fr">Apologie
pour Herodote</span></cite>, against the chastisements
inflicted on the Calvinists for the
mutilation of madonnas and images
of saints, exclaims: ‘Never did the
Egyptians take such cruel vengeance
for the murder of their cats, as has
been seen wreaked, in our days, on
those who had mutilated some <em>marmouzet</em>
or <i><span lang="fr">marionette</span></i>.’” It is curious
here again to trace the connection
between Roman image-worship and
the puppet-show. The marionette,
at first reverently placed in niches,
with spangled robe and burning lamp,
is presently found perched at the end
of a jester’s bauble and parading a
juggler’s board. The question here is
only of a name, soon abandoned by
the sacred images to its disreputable
usurpers. But we have already seen,
especially in the case of Spain, what
a scandalous confusion came to pass
between religious ceremonies and popular
entertainments, until at times these
could hardly be distinguished from
those; and, as far as what occurred
within them went, spectators might
often be perplexed to decide whether
they were in a sacred edifice or a
showman’s booth. With respect to
the French term <i><span lang="fr">marionette</span></i>, it had yet
to undergo, after its decline and fall
from a sacred to a profane application,
a still deeper degradation, before its
final confinement to the class of puppets
it at the present day indicates.
In the 16th century it came to be
applied not only to mechanical images
of all kinds, sacred and profane, but,
by a strange extension of its meaning,
to the supposed supernatural dolls
and malignant creatures that sorcerers
were accused of fostering, as familiar
imps and as idols. From a huge
quarto printed in Paris in 1622, containing
a collection of trials for magic
which took place between 1603 and
1615, M. Magnin extracts a passage
showing how certain poor idiots were
accused of “having kept, close confined
and in subjection in their houses,
<i><span lang="fr">marionettes</span></i>, which are little devils,
having usually the form of toads,
sometimes of apes, always very hideous.”
The rack, the gallows, and
the faggot were the usual lot of the
unfortunate supposed possessors of
these unwholesome puppets.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are instances on record of
long discussions and fierce disputes
between provinces or towns for the
honour of having been the birthplace
of some great hero, poet, or philosopher.
In like manner, M. Magnin
labours hard, and expends much erudition,
to prove that the French <i><span lang="fr">Polichinelle</span></i>,
notwithstanding the similarity
of name, is neither the son, nor in
any way related to the Italian <i><span lang="it">Pulcinella</span></i>,
but is thoroughly French in
origin and character. That Harlequin
and Pantaloon came from south of the
Alps he readily admits; also, that a
name has been borrowed from Italy
for the French Punch. But he stands
up manfully for the originality of this
jovial and dissipated puppet, which he
maintains to be a thoroughly Gallic
type. Whether conclusive or not—a
point to the settlement of which we
will not give many lines—the arguments
and facts he brings forward are
ingenious and amusing. After displaying
the marked difference that exists in
every respect, except in that of the long
hooked nose and the name, between
the Punchinello of Paris and that of
Naples—the latter being a tall straight-backed
active fellow, dressed in a black
half-mask, a grey pointed hat, a white
frock and trousers, and a tight girdle,
and altogether of a different character
from his more northern namesake—he
has the audacity to broach, although
with some hesitation, the bold idea
that Polichinelle is a portrait of the
great Béarnais. “To hide nothing of
my thought, I must say that, under
the necessary exaggeration of a loyal
caricature, Polichinelle exhibits the
popular type, I dare not say of Henry
IV., but at any rate of the Gascon
officer imitating his master’s bearing
in the guardroom of the palace of St
Germain, or of the old Louvre. As to
the hunch, it has been from time immemorial
the appendage, in France,
of a facetious, witty fellow. In the
thirteenth century, Adam de la Halle
was called the <em>hunchback of Arras</em>,
not that he was deformed, but on account
of his humorous vein.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The second hump, the one in front,
conspicuous under his spangled doublet,
reminds us of the glittering and
protuberant cuirass of men-at-arms,
and of the pigeon-breasted dress then
in fashion, which imitated the curve
of the cuirass.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The very hat of Polichinelle
(I do not refer to his modern
three-cornered covering, but to the
beaver, with brim turned up, which
he still wore in the seventeenth century),
was the hat of the gentlemen of
that day, the hat <em>à la Henri IV.</em> Finally,
certain characteristic features
of his face, as well as the bold jovial
amorous temper of the jolly fellow,
remind us, in caricature, of the qualities
and the defects of the Béarnais.
In short, notwithstanding his Neapolitan
name, Polichinelle appears to me
to be a completely national type, and
one of the most vivacious and sprightly
creations of French fancy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The first puppet-showmen in France
whose names have been handed down
to posterity, were a father and son
called Brioché. According to the most
authentic of the traditions collected,
Jean Brioché exercised, at the beginning
of Louis XIV.’s reign, the two
professions of tooth-drawer and puppet-player.
His station was at the
end of the Pont Neuf, near the gate
of Nesle, and his comrade was the
celebrated monkey Fagotin. With or
without his consent, Polichinelle was
about this time dragged into politics.
Amongst the numerous Mazarinades
and political satires that deluged Paris
in 1649, there was one entitled <em>Letter
from Polichinelle to Jules Mazarin</em>. It
was in prose, but ended by these three
lines, by way of signature:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="fr">Je suis Polichinelle,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">Qui fait la sentinelle</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">A la porte de Nesle.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is also likely that the letter was
the work of Brioché or Briocchi (who
was perhaps a countryman and <i><span lang="fr">protégé</span></i>
of the cardinal’s), written with
a view to attract notice and increase
his popularity (a good advertisement,
in short), than that it proceeded from
the pen of some political partisan.
But in any case it serves to show that
the French Punch was then a great
favourite in Paris. “I may boast,”
he is made to say in the letter, “without
vanity, Master Jules, that I have
always been better liked and more
respected by the people than you
have; for how many times have I,
with my own ears, heard them say:
‘Let us go and see Polichinelle!’
whereas nobody ever heard them say:
‘Let us go and see Mazarin!’” The
unfortunate Fagotin came to an untimely
end, if we are to put faith in a
little book now very rare (although it
has gone through several editions),
entitled, <cite><span lang="es">Combat de Cirano de Bergerac
contre le singe de Brioché</span></cite>. This
Cirano was a mad duellist of extreme
susceptibility. “His nose,” says
Ménage, “which was much disfigured,
was cause of the death of more than
ten persons. He could not endure
that any should look at him, and those
who did had forthwith to draw and
defend themselves.” This lunatic, it
is said, one day took Fagotin for a
lackey who was making faces at him,
and ran him through on the spot.
The story may have been a mere skit
on Cirano’s quarrelsome humour;
but the mistake he is said to have
made, appears by no means impossible
when we become acquainted with the
appearance and dress of the famous
monkey. “He was as big as a little
man, and a devil of a droll,” says the
author of the <cite><span lang="es">Combat de Cirano</span></cite>; “his
master had put him on an old Spanish
hat, whose dilapidations were concealed
by a plume; round his neck
was a frill <em>à la Scaramouche</em>; he wore
a doublet with six movable skirts,
trimmed with lace and tags—a garment
that gave him rather the look of
a lackey—and a shoulder-belt from
which hung a pointless blade.” It
was this innocent weapon, according
to the writer quoted from, that poor
Fagotin had the fatal temerity to
brandish against the terrible Cirano.
Whatever the manner of his death,
his fame lived long after him; and even
as certain famous French comedians
have transmitted their names to the
particular class of parts they filled
during their lives, so did Fagotin bequeath
his to all monkeys attached to
puppet-shows. Loret, in his metrical
narrative of the wonders of the fair of
St Germain’s in the year 1664, talks
of “the apes and fagotins;” La Fontaine
praises <cite>Fagotin’s tricks</cite> in his
fable of <cite>The Lion and his Court</cite>, and
Molière makes the sprightly and malicious
Dorine promise Tartuffe’s intended
wife that she shall have, in
carnival time,</p>

<p class='c016'>Great honour, indeed, for a quadrumane
comedian, to obtain even incidental
mention from France’s first
fabulist and greatest dramatist. It
was at about the time of Tartuffe’s
performance (1669) that puppet-shows
appear to have been at the
zenith of their popularity in France,
and in the enjoyment of court favour.
In the accounts of expenditure of the
royal treasury is noted a payment
of 1365 livres “to Brioché, player of
marionettes, for the stay he made
at St Germain-en-Laye during the
months of September, October, and
November, to divert the royal children.”
Brioché had been preceded
by another puppet-showman, who had
remained nearly two months. The
dauphin was then nine years old, and
evidently very fond of Polichinelle—to
whose exploits and drolleries, and
to the tricks of Fagotin, it is not, however,
to be supposed that the attractions
of Brioché’s performances were
confined. He and his brother showman
had doubtless a numerous company
of marionettes, performing a
great variety of pieces, since they
were able to amuse the dauphin and
his juvenile court for nearly five
months without intermission. Like
all distinguished men, Brioché, decidedly
one of the celebrities of his
time, and to whom we find constant
allusions in the prose and verse of
that day, had his enemies and his
rivals. Amongst the former was to
be reckoned no less a personage than
Bossuet, who denounced marionettes
(with a severity that might rather
have been expected from some
straight-laced Calvinist than from a
prelate of Rome) as a shameful and
impure entertainment, calculated to
counteract his laborious efforts for the
salvation of his flock. M. Magnin’s
extensive researches in puppet chronicles
leave him convinced that the
eloquent bishop must have been in
bilious temper when thus attacking
the poor little figures whose worst
offences were a few harmless drolleries.
Anthony Hamilton, in a letter,
half verse and half prose, addressed
to the daughter of James II. of England,
describes the fête of St Germain-en-Laye,
and gives us the measure of
the marionettes’ transgressions. “The
famous Polichinelle,” he says, “the
hero of that stage, is a little free in
his discourse, but not sufficiently so to
bring a blush to the cheek of the damsel
he diverts by his witticisms.” We
would not take Anthony Hamilton’s
evidence in such matters for more
than it is worth. There was, no
doubt, a fair share of license in the
pieces arranged for these puppets, or
in the jests introduced by their invisible
readers; and as regards their
actions, M. Magnin himself tells us
of the <em>houzarde</em>, an extremely <i><span lang="fr">gaillarde</span></i>
dance, resembling that called
the <em>antiquaile</em> mentioned in Rabelais.
Notwithstanding which, the marionettes
were in great favour with very
honest people, and Charles Perrault,
one of the most distinguished members
of the old French Academy,
praised them in verse as an agreeable
pastime. The jokes Brioché put into
the mouths of his actors were greatly
to the taste of the Parisians; so much
so that when an English mechanician
exhibited other puppets which he had
contrived to move by springs instead
of strings, the public still preferred
Brioché, “on account of the drolleries
he made them say.” That he was not
always and everywhere so successful,
we learn by a quaint extract from the
<cite><span lang="es">Combat de Cirano</span></cite>, already mentioned.
Brioché, says the facetious author,
“one day took it into his head to
ramble afar with his little restless
wooden Æsop, twisting, turning,
dancing, laughing, chattering, &#38;c.
This heteroclite marmouzet, or, better
to speak, this comical hunchback,
was called Polichinelle. His comrade’s
name was Voisin. (More
likely, suggests M. Magnin, the <i><span lang="fr">voisin</span></i>,
the neighbour or gossip of Polichinelle.)
After visiting several towns
and villages, they got on Swiss ground
in a canton where marionettes were
unknown. Polichinelle having shown
his phiz, as well as all his gang, in
presence of a people given to burn
sorcerers, they accused Brioché to the
magistrate. Witnesses declared that
they had heard little figures jabber
and talk, and that they must be devils.
Judgment was pronounced against the
master of this wooden company animated
by springs. But for the interference
of a man of sense they would
have made a roast of Brioché. They
contented themselves with stripping
the marionettes naked. <i><span lang="it">O poveretta!</span></i>”
The same story is told by the Abbé
d’Artigny, who lays the scene at Soleure,
and says that Brioché owed his release
to a captain of the French-Swiss
regiment then recruiting in the cantons.
Punch at that time had powerful
protectors. Brioché’s son and successor,
Francis, whom the Parisians
familiarly called <em>Fanchon</em>, having been
offensively interfered with, wrote at
once to the king. It would seem
that, without quitting the vicinity of
the Pont Neuf, he desired to transfer
his standing to the Faubourg St Germains
end, and that the commissaire
of that district prohibited his exhibition.
On the 16th October 1676, the
great Colbert wrote to the lieutenant-general
of police, communicating his
majesty’s commands that Brioché
should be permitted to exercise his
calling, and should have a proper
place assigned to him where he might
do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>The history of the French marionettes,
during the first half of the
eighteenth century, is given in considerable
detail by M. Magnin, but
does not contain any very striking
episodes. It is to be feared their
morals got rather relaxed during the
latter years of Louis XIV.’s reign,
and under the Regency, and Bossuet
might then have thundered against
them with greater reason than in
1686. Towards the middle of the
century, a great change took place
in the character of their performances:
witty jests, and allusions to the scandal
of court and city, were neglected for
the sake of mechanical effects and
surprises; the vaudeville and polished
farce, for which the French stage
has long been and still is famous,
were replaced by showy dramas and
<i><span lang="fr">pièces à spectacle</span></i>, in which the military
element seems to have predominated,
judging from the titles of some
of them—The Bombardment of Antwerp,
The Taking of Charleroi, The
General Assault of Bergen-op-Zoom.
It was the commencement of the
decline of puppet performances in
France; the public taste underwent
a change; the eye was to be gratified,
wit and satire were in great
measure dispensed with. “Vaucanson’s
automatons, the flute-player,
the duck, &#38;c., were imitated in every
way, and people ran in crowds to see
Kempel’s chess-player. At the fair
of St Germains, in 1744, a Pole,
named Toscani, opened a picturesque
and automatical theatre, which seems
to have served as a prelude to M.
Pierre’s famous show. ‘Here are to
be seen,’ said the bills, ‘mountains,
castles, marine views; also figures
that perfectly imitate all natural
movements, without being visibly
acted upon by any string; and, which
is still more surprising, here are seen
a storm, rain, thunder, vessels perishing,
sailors swimming, &#38;c.’ On all
hands such marvels as these were
announced, and also (I blush to write
it) combats of wild animals.” Bull
and bear baits, wolf and dog fights,
in refined France, just a century ago,
for all the world as in England in the
days of buxom Queen Bess. M.
Magnin copies an advertisement of
one of these savage exhibitions,
which might pass for a translated
placard of the beast-fighting establishment
that complained of the opposition
made to them by Will Shakespeare
and his players. Martin was
the name of the man who kept the
pit at the <i><span lang="fr">barrière de Sèvres</span></i>; and
after lauding the wickedness of his
bull, the tenacity of his dogs, and the
exceeding fierceness of his new wolf,
he informs the public that he has
“pure bear oil for sale.” When
Paris ran after such coarse diversions
as these, what hope was there for the
elves of the puppet-show? Punch
shrugged his hump, and crept moodily
into a corner. Bull-rings and mechanism
were too many for him.
Twenty years later we find him again
in high favour and feather at the fair
of St Germains, where Audinot, an
author and ex-singer at the united
comic and Italian operas, having
quarrelled with his comrades and quitted
the theatre, exhibited large marionettes,
which he called <i><span lang="fr">bamboches</span></i>,
and which were striking likenesses
of the performers at the Opéra Comique,
Laruette, Clairval, Madam
Bérard, and himself. Polichinelle
appeared amongst them in the character
of a gentleman of the bedchamber,
and found the same sort of
popularity that Cassandrino has since
enjoyed at Rome. The monarchy
was in its decline, the follies and
vices of the courtiers of the 18th
century had brought them into contempt,
and a parody of them was
welcome to the people. The fair
over, Audinot installed his puppets
in a little theatre on the boulevard,
which he called the <i><span lang="fr">Ambigu Comique</span></i>,
to indicate the variety of the entertainments
there given, and there he
brought out several new pieces, one,
amongst others, entitled <cite><span lang="fr">Le Testament
de Polichinelle</span></cite>. It was quite
time for Punch to make his will; his
theatre was in a very weakly state.
It became the fashion to replace
puppets by children; and one hears
little more of marionettes in France
until Seraphin revives them in his
<cite><span lang="fr">Ombres Chinoises</span></cite>. Few persons who
have been in Paris will have failed to
notice, when walking round the
Palais Royal between two and three
in the afternoon, or seven and nine
in the evening, a shrivelled weary-looking
man, standing just within the
railings that separate the gallery
from the garden, and continually repeating,
in a tone between a whine,
a chant, and a croak, a monotonous
formula, at first not very intelligible to
a foreigner. This man has acquired
all the rights that long occupation can
give: the flagstone whereon, day
after day, as long as we can remember—and
doubtless for a score or two
of years before—he has stood sentry,
is worn hollow by the shuffling movement
by which he endeavours to
retain warmth in his feet. He is
identified with the railings against
which he stands, and is as much a
part of the Palais Royal as the glass
gallery, Chevet’s shop, or the cannon
that daily fires itself off at noon. A
little attention enables one to discover
the purport of his unvarying harangue.
It begins with “<i><span lang="fr">Les Ombres Chinoises
de Seraphin</span></i>”—this very drawlingly
spoken—and ends with “<i><span lang="fr">Prrrrenez
vos billets</span></i>”—a rattle on the <em>r</em>, and
the word <i><span lang="fr">billets</span></i> dying away in a sort
of exhausted whine. In 1784, the
ingenious Dominique Seraphin exhibited
his Chinese shadows several
times before the royal family at Versailles,
was allowed to call his theatre
“<i><span lang="fr">Spectacle des Enfans de France</span></i>,”
and took up his quarters in the Palais
Royal, in the very house opposite to
whose door the monotonous and
melancholy man above described at
the present day “touts” for an audience.
There for seventy years Seraphin
and his descendants have
pulled the strings of their puppets.
But here, as M. Magnin observes, it
is no longer movable <em>sculpture</em>, but
movable <em>painting</em>—the shadows of
figures cut out of sheets of pasteboard
or leather, and placed between a
strong light and a transparent curtain.
The shadows, owing doubtless to
their intangible nature, have passed
unscathed through the countless political
changes and convulsions that
have occurred during the three quarters
of a century that they have inhabited
a nook in the palace which
has been alternately Cardinal, Royal,
National, Imperial—all things by
turn, and nothing long. They have
lasted and thriven, as far as bodiless
shades can thrive, under Republic
and Empire, Directory and Consulate,
Restoration and Citizen Monarchy,
Republic, and Empire again.
We fear it must be admitted that
time-serving is at the bottom of this
long impunity and prosperity. In the
feverish days of the first Revolution,
marionettes had <i><span lang="fr">sans-culotte</span></i> tendencies,
with the exception of Polichinelle,
who, mindful doubtless of
his descent from Henry IV., played
the aristocrat, and carried his head
so high, that at last he lost it. M.
Magnin passes hastily over this affecting
phase in the career of his puppet
friends, merely quoting a few
lines from Camille Desmoulins, which
bear upon the subject. “This selfish
multitude,” exclaims the <cite><span lang="fr">Vieux
Cordelier</span></cite>, indignant at the apathetic
indifference of the Parisians in presence
of daily human hecatombs, “is formed
to follow blindly the impulse of the
strongest. There was fighting in the
Carrousel and the Champ de Mars,
and the Palais Royal displayed its
shepherdesses and its Arcadia. Close
by the guillotine, beneath whose keen
edge fell crowned heads, on the same
square, and at the same time, <em>they
also guillotined Polichinelle</em>, who
divided the attention of the eager
crowd.” Punch, who had passed his
life hanging the hangman, was at a
nonplus in presence of the guillotine.
He missed the running noose he was
so skilful in drawing tight, and
mournfully laid his neck in the bloody
groove. Some say that he escaped,
that his dog was dressed up, and
beheaded in his stead, and that he
himself reached a foreign shore, where
he presently regained his freedom of
speech and former jollity of character.
M. Magnin himself is clearly of
opinion that he is not dead, but only
sleeps. “Would it not be well,” he
asks, “to awaken him here in France?
Can it be that the little Æsop has
nothing new to tell us? Above all,
do not say that he is dead. Polichinelle
never dies. You doubt it?
You do not know then what Polichinelle
is? He is the good sense of
the people, the brisk sally, the irrepressible
laugh. Yes, Polichinelle
will laugh, sing, and hiss, as long as
the world contains vices, follies, and
things to ridicule. You see very well
that Polichinelle is not near his death.
Polichinelle is immortal!”</p>

<p class='c009'>To England M. Magnin allots nearly
as many pages as to his own country,
and displays in them a rare acquaintance
with our language, literature, and
customs. It would in no way have
surprised him, he says, had the playful
and lightsome muse of the puppet-show
been made less welcome by the
Germanic races than by nations of
Greco-Roman origin. The grave and
more earnest temper generally attributed
to the former would have accounted
for their disregard of a pastime
they might deem frivolous, and
fail to appreciate. He was well pleased,
then, to find his wooden clients,
his well-beloved marionettes, as popular
and as well understood on the
banks of the Thames, the Oder, and
the Zuyder Zee, as in Naples, Paris, or
Seville. “In England especially,” he
says, “the taste for this kind of spectacle
has been so widely diffused, that
one could hardly name a single poet,
from Chaucer to Lord Byron, or a
single prose-writer, from Sir Philip
Sydney to Hazlitt, in whose works
are not to be found abundant information
on the subject, or frequent allusions
to it. The dramatists, above
all, beginning with those who are the
glory of the reigns of Elizabeth and
James I., supply us with the most
curious particulars of the repertory,
the managers, and the stage of the
marionettes. Shakespeare himself
has not disdained to draw from this
singular arsenal ingenious or energetic
metaphors, which he places in the
mouths of his most tragic personages
at the most pathetic moments. I can
name ten or twelve of his plays in
which this occurs.” (The list follows.)
“The cotemporaries and successors of
this great poet—Ben Jonson, Beaumont
and Fletcher, Milton, Davenant,
Swift, Addison, Gay, Fielding, Goldsmith,
Sheridan—have also borrowed
many moral or satirical sallies from
this popular diversion. Thanks to this
singular tendency of the English dramatists
to busy themselves with the
proceedings of their little street-corner
rivals, I have found in their writings
much assistance—as agreeable as unexpected—in
the task I have undertaken.
Deprived, as one necessarily
is in a foreign country, of direct sources
and original pamphlets, having at my
disposal only those standard works of
great writers that are to be met with
on the shelves of every library, I have
found it sufficient, strange to say! to
collate the passages so abundantly
furnished me by these chosen authors
to form a collection of documents concerning
English puppets more circumstantial
and more complete, I venture
to think, than any that have hitherto
been got together by the best-informed
native critics.” Others, if they please,
may controvert the claim here put forward;
we shall content ourselves with
saying that the amount of research
manifested in M. Magnin’s long essay
on English puppets does as much
credit to his industry as the manner
of the compilation does to his judgment,
acumen, and literary talent.
It must be observed, however, that
he has not altogether limited himself,
when seeking materials and authorities,
to the chosen corps of English dramatists,
poets, and essayists, but has consulted
sundry antiquarian authorities,
tracts of the time of the commonwealth,
the works of Hogarth, those of
Hone, Payne Collier, Thomas Wright,
and other modern or cotemporary
writers. At the same time, this portion
of his book contains much that
will be novel to most English readers,
and abounds in curious details and
pertinent reflections on old English
character and usages. If we do not
dwell upon it at some length, it is
because we desire, whilst room remains,
to devote a page or two to
Germany and the Northerns. We
must not omit, however, to mention
that M. Magnin joins issue with Mr
Payne Collier on the question of the
origin of the English Punch. Mr
Collier makes him date from 1688,
and brings him over from Holland in
the same ship with William of Orange.
M. Magnin takes a different view, and
makes out a very fair case. He begins
by remarking that several false
derivations have been assigned to the
name of Punch. “Some have imagined
I know not what secret and fantastical
connection between Punch’s
name, and even between the fire of
Punch’s wit, and the ardent beverage
of which the recipe, it is said, came to
us from Persia. It is going a great deal
too far in search of an error. Punch
is simply the name of our friend <em>Pulchinello</em>,
a little altered and contracted
by the monosyllabic genius of the
English language. In the early period
of his career in England we find the
names Punch and Punchinello used
indifferently for each other. Is it
quite certain that Punch came to London
from the Hague, in the suite of
William III.? I have doubts of it.
His learned biographer admits that
there are traces of his presence in
England previous to the abdication of
James II.... Certain passages
of Addison’s pretty Latin poem on
puppet-shows (<cite><span lang="la">Machinæ Gesticulantes</span></cite>)
prove that Punch’s theatre was in
great progress on the old London
puppet-shows in the days of Queen
Elizabeth.” The personal appearance,
and some of the characteristics
of Punch, certainly induce a belief
that he is of French origin; and even
though it be proved that he was imported
into England from Holland,
may it not be admitted as highly
probable that he went to the latter
country with the refugees, who for
several years previously to the Revolution
of 1688 had been flocking
thither from France? We risk the
question with all diffidence, and without
the slightest intention of pronouncing
judgment on so important
a matter. And as we have no intention
or desire to take up the cudgels
in behalf of the origin of that Punch,
who, as the unfortunate and much-battered
Judy can testify, himself
handles those weapons so efficiently,
we refer the reader to M. Magnin for
the <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em> of the argument, and
start upon a rapid tour through Germany
and northern Europe. M.
Magnin accelerates his pace as he approaches
the close of his journey, and
pauses there only where his attention
is arrested by some striking novelty
or original feature, to omit mention
of which would be to leave a gap
in the history he has undertaken to
write.</p>

<p class='c009'>Germany is the native land and
head-quarters of wood-cutters. We
mean not hewers of wood for the
furnace, but cunning carvers in smooth-grained
beech and delicate deal;
artists in timber, we may truly say,
when we contemplate the graceful
and beautiful objects for which we
are indebted to the luxuriant forests
and skilful knives of Baden and
Bavaria. The Teutonic race also
possess, in a very high degree, the
mechanical genius, to be convinced of
which we have but to look at the
ingenious clocks, with their astronomical
evolutions, moving figures,
crowing cocks, and the like, so constantly
met with in all parts of
Germany, in Switzerland, and in Holland.
This double aptitude brought
about an early development of anatomical
sculpture in Germany, applied,
as usual, to various purposes, religious
and civil, serious and recreative, wonderful
images of saints, figures borne
in municipal processions, and dramatic
puppets. These latter are traced
by M. Magnin as far back as the 12th
century. Even in a manuscript of the
10th century he finds the word <em>Tocha</em>
or <em>Docha</em> used in the sense of doll or
puppet (<em>puppa</em>), and also in that of
mime (<em>mima</em>, <em>mimula</em>). Somewhat
later the word <em>Tokke-spil</em> (puppet-show)
occurs in the poems of the
Minnesingers. One of these, Master
Sigeher, when stigmatising the Pope’s
abuse of his influence with the Electors
of the Empire, writes—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="de">Als der Tokken spilt der Welche mit Tutschen Vürsten.</span>”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Italian plays with the German princes as with puppets.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There still exists in the library at
Strasburg a manuscript dating from
the end of the 12th century, and
adorned with a great number of
curious miniatures, one of which,
under the strange title of <cite><span lang="la">Ludus Monstrorum</span></cite>,
represents a puppet-show.
Two little figures, armed <em>cap-à-pie</em>,
are made to move and fight by means
of a string, whose ends two showmen
hold. The painting proves not only
the existence of marionettes at that
period, but also that they were sufficiently
common to supply a symbol
intelligible to all, since it is put as an
illustration to a moral reflection on
the vanity of human things. From
the equipment of the figures it may
also be inferred that military subjects
were then in favour on the narrow
stage of the puppet-show. And M.
Magnin, zealous to track his fox to
its very earth, risks the word <em>Niebelungen</em>,
but brings no evidence to support
his surmise. In the 14th and
15th centuries we obtain more positive
data as to the nature of the <em>puppenspiel</em>,
and of its performances. Romantic
subjects, historical fables, were
then in fashion—the four sons of
Aymon, Genevieve of Brabant, the
Lady of Roussillon, to whom her
lover’s heart was given to eat, and
who killed herself in her despair.
The history of Joan of Arc was also
a favourite subject. That heroine had
an episodical part in a piece performed
at Ratisbon in 1430. “There exists,”
says M. Magnin, “a precious testimony
to a performance of marionettes
at that period. In a fragment
of the poem of Malagis, written in
Germany in the 15th century, after a
Flemish translation of our old romance
of Maugis, the fairy Oriande de Rosefleur,
who has been separated for
fifteen years from her beloved pupil,
Malagis, arrives, disguised as a juggler,
at the castle of Rigremont, where
a wedding is being celebrated. She
offers the company the diversion of a
puppet-show; it is accepted; she asks
for a table to serve as a stage, and
exhibits upon it two figures, a male
and female magician. Into their
mouths she puts stanzas, which tell
her history and cause her to be recognised
by Malagis. M. Von der Hagen
has published this fragment from the
MS. preserved at Heidelberg, in
<cite><span lang="la">Germania</span></cite>, vol. viii., p. 280. The
scene in question is not to be found
either in the French poem or the
French prose romance.” The 16th
century was an epoch in the annals
of German puppets. Scepticism and
sorcery were the order of the day.
Faust stepped upon the stage and
held it long.</p>

<p class='c009'>It appears to have been the custom,
rarely deviated from by the puppet-shows
of any nation or time, to have
a comic character or buffoon, who
intruded, even in the most tragical
pieces, to give by his jests variety
and relief to the performance. There
was nothing odd or startling in this
in the Middle Ages, when every great
personage—emperor, king, or prelate—had
his licensed jester attached
to his household. M. Magnin is in
some doubt as to the name first given
to this character in Germany, unless
it was Eulenspiegel (a name which in
modern times has acquired some celebrity
as a literary pseudonyme), or
rather Master Hemmerlein, whose
caustic sarcasm partakes at once of
the humour of the devil and the hangman.
Master Hemmerlein, according
to Frisch, had a face like a frightful
mask; he belonged to the lowest class
of marionettes, under whose dress
the showman passes his hand to move
them. This author adds that the
name of Hemmerlein was sometimes
given to the public executioner, and
that it is applied to the devil in the
<cite><span lang="la">Breviarium Historicum</span></cite> of Sebald.
This will bear explanation. The word
Hämmerlein or Hämmerling (the
latter is now the usual orthography)
has three very distinct meanings—a
jack-pudding, a flayer, and a gold-hammer
(bird). The German headsman,
in former days, combined with
his terrible duties the occupation of a
flayer or knacker, charged to remove
dead horses and other carrion; hence
he was commonly spoken of as Master
Hämmerlein.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>It is difficult to say by what grim
mockery or strange assimilation his
name was applied to the buffoon of
the puppet-show. We have little information,
however, concerning Hämmerlein
the droll, who appears to have
had but a short reign when he was
supplanted by the famous <em>Hanswurst</em>,
to whom out-spoken Martin Luther
compared Duke Henry of Brunswick.
“Miserable, choleric spirit” (here
Martin addresses himself to Satan),
“you, and your poor possessed creature
Henry, you know, as well as all
your poets and writers, that the name
of <em>Hanswurst</em> is not of my invention;
others have employed it before me,
to designate those rude and unlucky
persons who, desiring to exhibit finesse,
commit but clumsiness and impropriety.”
And that there might be no
mistake as to his application of the
word, he adds: “Many persons compare
my very gracious lord, Duke
Henry of Brunswick, to <em>Hanswurst</em>,
because the said lord is replete and
corpulent.” One of the consequences
in Germany of Luther’s preachings,
and of the more fanatical denunciations
of some of his disciples and
cotemporaries, was terrible havoc
amongst church pictures and statues,
including automatical images and
groups, then very numerous in that
country, and an end was at that time
put to dramatic church ceremonies,
not only in districts that embraced
the new doctrine, but in many that
adhered to Rome. Some of the performances
were of the most grotesque
description. They were particularly
frequent in Poland, where, at Christmas
time, in many churches, and
especially in those of monasteries, the
people were amused between mass
and vespers, by the play of the <cite><span lang="pl">Szopka</span></cite>
or stable. “In this kind of drama,”
says M. Magnin, “<i><span lang="pl">lalki</span></i> (little dolls
of wood or card-board) represented
Mary, Jesus, Joseph, the angels, the
shepherds, and the three Magi on their
knees, with their offerings of gold,
incense, and myrrh, not forgetting
the ox, the ass, and St. John the
Baptist’s lamb. Then came the massacre
of the innocents, in the midst of
which Herod’s own son perished by
mistake. The wicked prince, in his
despair, called upon death, who soon
made his appearance, in the form of a
skeleton, and cut off his head with his
scythe. Then a black devil ascended,
with a red tongue, pointed horns, and
a long tail, picked up the king’s body
on the end of his pitchfork, and
carried it off to the infernal regions.”
This strange performance was continued
in the Polish churches until
the middle of the 18th century, with
numerous indecorous variations. Expelled
from consecrated edifices, it is
nevertheless preserved to the present
day, as a popular diversion, in all the
provinces of the defunct kingdom of
Poland. From Christmas-tide to
Shrove Tuesday it is welcomed by
both the rural and the urban population,
by the peasantry, the middle
classes, and even in the dwellings of
the nobility.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Germany, the last twenty years
of the seventeenth century witnessed
a violent struggle between the church
and the stage, or it should rather be
said a relentless persecution of the
latter by the former, which could oppose
only remonstrances to the intolerant
rigour of the consistories.
The quarrel had its origin at Hamburg.
A clergyman refused to administer
the sacrament to two stage-players.
An ardent controversy ensued; the
dispute became envenomed; the Protestant
clergy made common cause;
the anti-theatrical movement spread
over all Germany. In vain did several
universities, appealed to by the comedians,
prove, from the most respectable
authorities, the innocence of their
profession, of which the actors themselves
published sensible and judicious
defences; in vain did several princes
endeavour to counterbalance, by
marks of esteem and consideration,
the exaggerated severity of the theologians;
the majority of the public
sided with its pastors. Players were
avoided as dissolute vagabonds; and
although, whilst condemning the performers,
people did not cease to frequent
the performances, a great many
comedians, feeling themselves humiliated,
abandoned the stage to foreigners
and to marionettes. The regular
theatres rapidly decreased in number,
and puppet-shows augmented in a
like ratio. “At the end of the 17th
century,” says Flögel, “the <cite><span lang="de">Haupt-und-Staatsactionen</span></cite>
usurped the place
of the real drama. These pieces were
played sometimes by mechanical
dolls, sometimes by actors.” The
meaning of the term <cite><span lang="de">Haupt-und-Staatsaction</span></cite>
is rather obscure, but it
was in fact applied to almost every
kind of piece performed by puppets.
It was bound to include a great deal
of incident and show, to be supported
by occasional instrumental music, and
to have a comic personage or buffoon
amongst its characters. The tenth
chapter of M. Magnin’s fifth and final
section shows us a strange variety in
the subjects selected for these plays—in
which, it is to be noted, each puppet
had its own separate speaker
behind the scenes. Weltheim, the
manager of a company of marionettes
in the last twenty years of the
17th century, and the beginning of
the 18th, usually recruited interpreters
for his puppets amongst the
students of Leipzig and Jena. He
was the first who performed a translation
of Molière’s comedies in Germany.
In 1688, we find him giving
at Hamburg, a piece founded on the
fall of Adam and Eve, followed by a
buffoonery called <cite>Jack-pudding in
Punch’s Shop</cite>. Then we come to such
pieces as <cite>The Lapidation of Naboth</cite>;
<cite>Asphalides, King of Arabia</cite>; <cite>The
Fall of Jerusalem</cite>, and <cite>The Death of
Wallenstein</cite>—a strange medley of ancient,
modern, sacred and profane
history. The following performance,
at which M. Schütze, the historian of
the Hamburg theatre, declares that
he was present in his youth, must
have been as curious as any we have
named. “A little musical drama on
the fall of Adam and Eve (performed
at Hamburg rather more than a century
ago), the characters in which,
including that of the serpent, were
filled by puppets. The reptile was
seen coiled round the tree, darting
out his pernicious tongue. After the
fall of our first parents, Hanswurst
addressed them in a strain of coarse
pleasantry that greatly diverted the
audience. Two bears danced a ballet,
and at the end, an angel appeared, as
in Genesis, drew a sword of gilt
paper, and cut at a single blow the
knot of the piece.” Later than this
a tailor named Reibehand, who kept
a puppet theatre, contrived to burlesque
the touching parable of the
Prodigal Son. His playbill ran thus:
“The arch-prodigal, chastised by the
four elements, with Harlequin, the
joyous companion of a great criminal.”
The merit of this most irreverent
<cite><span lang="de">Haupt-Action</span></cite> consisted in the transformations
it contained. Thus the
fruit the young prodigal was about to
eat changed itself into death’s heads,
the water he was about to drink, into
flames; rocks split open and revealed
a gallows with a man hanging from
it. The limbs of this corpse swinging
in the wind, fell off one by one, then
assembled upon the ground and reconnected
themselves, and then the
dead man arose and pursued the
prodigal. A very German and not
very pleasing device. When Charles
XII. of Sweden fell dead in the
trenches at Friedrichshall, slain, according
to popular superstition, by an
enchanted bullet, his death was immediately
taken advantage of by the indefatigable
marionettes. A great historical
piece was brought out at Hamburg,
in which Friedrichshall was
twice bombarded. In it a soldier
excited great admiration as a prodigy
of mechanism, by lighting his pipe
and puffing smoke from his mouth.
This feat was soon imported into
France, and may be seen at the present
day executed in great perfection
at Seraphin’s theatre in the Palais
Royal.</p>

<p class='c009'>The triviality, absurdity, and profanity
that tarnished the German
stage during the first half of the
eighteenth century, were followed by
a reaction in favour of better taste
and common sense. Gottsched and
Lessing gave the signal of the revival
of art and poetry. The theatre resumed
its importance; actors their
proper place, from which they had
been ousted by the intolerance of the
consistories; puppets returned to the
modest sphere which circumstances
had permitted and encouraged them
temporarily to quit, and resumed their
old stock pieces, consisting of Biblical
dramas and popular legends. Faust
was exceedingly popular, and novelties
were occasionally introduced.
Lewis’s <cite>Bravo of Venice</cite> was taken
for the subject of a grand drama,
performed by the Augsburg marionettes,
which also played, with great
success, a drama founded on the well-known
story of Don Juan and his
marble guest. And this brings us to
the time when a boy, Wolfgang Goethe
by name—kept at home by his parents
during certain gloomy episodes of the
Seven Years’ War, when Frankfort
was occupied by the French—delighted
his leisure with a marionette theatre,
a Christmas gift from his grandfather,
and so fostered his inborn dramatic
taste and genius. In his memoirs,
and in <em>Wilhelm Meister</em>, he tells us,
in some charming passages, what
pleasure he took in the management
of his mimic comedians.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are indebted,” says M. Magnin,
“for what follows, to a confidential
communication made by the illustrious
composer Haydn, at Vienna, in 1805,
to M. Charles Bertuch, one of his
fervent admirers.” And he relates
that when Hadyn was <i><span lang="fr">mâitre de
chapelle</span></i> to Prince Nicholas-Joseph
Esterhazy, that enlightened and generous
patron of art, and especially of
music, he composed four little operas
for a marionette theatre, which existed
in the Esterhazys’ magnificent
Castle of Eisenstadt in Hungary.
They were written between 1773 and
1780. “In the list of all his musical
works, which the illustrious old man
signed and gave to M. Charles Bertuch,
during the residence of the latter
at Vienna, occur the following lines,
which I exactly transcribe:—<cite>Operette</cite>
composed for the marionettes: <cite>Philémon
and Baucis</cite>, 1773; <cite>Geniêvre</cite>,
1777; <cite>Didon</cite>, parody, 1778; <cite><span lang="fr">La Vengeance
accomplie ou la Maison Brulie</span></cite>
(no date). In the same list the <cite>Diable
Boiteux</cite> is set down, probably because
it was played by Prince Esterhazy’s
marionettes, but it was composed at
Vienna, in the author’s early youth,
for Bernardone, the manager of a
popular theatre at the Corinthian
Gate, and twenty-four sequins were
paid for it. It was thought that these
curious operas, all unpublished, had
been destroyed in a fire which consumed
a part of the Castle of Eisenstadt,
including Haydn’s apartment;
but that was not the case, for they
were seen in 1827 in the musical
library of the Esterhazys, with a score
of other pieces whose titles one would
like to know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Goethe has told us, in an interesting
passage of his memoirs, that the idea
of his great work of Faust was suggested
to him by the puppet-show.
M. Magnin, who takes an affectionate
interest in the triumphs of the marionettes
with whom he has so long associated,
and whose career he has
traced from their cradle, exults in the
claim they have thus acquired to
the world’s gratitude—not always, it
must be owned, shown to those who
best deserve it. He concludes his
history with a double recapitulation—first,
of the celebrated persons who
have taken pleasure in this class of
dramatic performances; and, secondly,
of the most distinguished of those
who have wielded pen in its service.
And he calls upon his readers to applaud,
and upon the ladies especially
to wave kerchief and throw bouquet
at the graceful <span class='sc'>Fantasia</span>, the pretty
fairy, the sprightly muse of the marionettes.
We doubt not but that the
appeal will be responded to; although
her fairyship may fairly be considered
to be already sufficiently rewarded by
meeting with a biographer in every
way so competent.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>THE QUIET HEART.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c019'>PART V.—CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p class='c020'>But this Menie Laurie, rising up
from her bed of unrest, when the
morning light breaks, cold and real,
upon a changed world, has wept out
all her child’s tears, and is a woman
once again. No one knows yet a
whisper of what has befallen her, not
even poor Jenny, who sobbed over
her last night, and implored her not
to weep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, how to tell this—how to signify,
in the fewest and calmest words,
the change that has come upon her.
Sitting, with her cheek leant on her
hand, by the window where she heard
it, before any other eyes are awake,
Menie ponders this in her heart. Always
before in little difficulties counsel
and help have been within her
reach; few troublous things have been
to do in Menie’s experience; and no
one ever dreamt that <em>she</em> should do
them, when they chanced to come to
her mother’s door.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now her mother’s honour is involved—she
must not be consulted—she
must not know. With a proud
flush Menie draws up herself—herself
who must work in this alone. Ah,
sweet dependence, dear humility of
the old times! we must lay them by
out of our heart, to wait for a happier
dawn. This day it is independence—self-support—a
strength that stands
alone; and no one who has not felt
such an abrupt transition can know
how hard it is to take these unused
weapons up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you let me speak to you,
aunt?” Menie’s heart falters within
her, as she remembers poor Miss Annie’s
unaccepted sympathy. Has she
indeed been driven to seek refuge here
at last?</p>

<p class='c009'>“My love! how can you ask such
a question, darling, when I am always
ready to speak to you?” exclaimed
Miss Annie, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But not here—out of doors, if you
will permit me,” said Menie in a half
whisper. “I—I want to be out of
my mother’s sight—she must not
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You delightful creature,” said
Miss Annie, “are you going to give
me your confidence at last?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Menie, sadly dismayed, was
very ill able to support this strain of
sympathy. She hastened out, not
quite observing how it tasked her
companion to follow her—out to the
same green overgrown corner, where
once before she had spoken of this
same subject to Randall himself. With
a slight shudder she paused there before
the little rustic seat, from which
she had risen at his approach; but
Menie knew that she must harden
herself against the power of associations;
enough of real ill was before
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to tell you, aunt, if you
will please to listen to me, that the
engagement of which you were told
when we came here is dissolved—broken.
I do not know if there is
any stronger word,” said Menie, a
bewildered look growing on her face.
“I mean to say, that it is all over,
as if it had never been.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Menie folded her hands upon
her breast, and stood patiently to listen,
expecting a burst of lamentation
and condolence; but Menie was not
prepared for the laugh which rung
shrilly on her ears—the words that
followed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My sweet simple child, I have no
doubt you quite believe it—forgive
me for laughing, darling; but I know
what lovers’ quarrels are. There, now,
don’t look so grave and angry; my
love, you will make it all up to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Miss Annie Laurie patted Menie’s
shrinking shoulder encouragingly.
It was a harder task this than
Menie had anticipated; but she went
on without flinching.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is no lovers’ quarrel, aunt;
do not think so. My mother is in
some degree involved in this. I cannot
consult her, or ask her to help me;
it is the first time I have ever been in
such a strait;” and Menie’s lip quivered
as she spoke. “You are my
only friend. I am serious—as serious
as mind can be, which feels that here
it decides its life. Aunt, I apply to
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Annie Laurie looked up very
much confused and shaken; very seldom
had any one spoken to her with
such a sober seriousness of tone; she
could not think it unreal, for neither
extravagance nor despair were in these
grave sad words of Menie. The poor
frivolous heart felt this voice ring into
its depths, past all superficial affectations
and sentiments. No exuberance
of sympathy, no shower of condoling
words or endearments, could answer
this appeal; and poor Miss Annie
faltered before this claim of real service—faltered
and shrank into a very
weak old woman, her self-delusions
standing her in no stead in such a
strait; and the only answer she could
make was to cry, in a trembling and
strangely altered voice, “Oh, child,
do not speak so. What can I do for
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Most true, what can you do, indeed,
poor soul! whose greatest object for
all these years has been to shut out
and darken the daylight truth, which
mocked your vain pretences? You
could give charity and gentle words—be
thankful; your heart is alive in you
because of these: but what can you
do in such a difficulty as this? where
is your wisdom to counsel, your
strength to uphold? This grave girl
stands before you, sadly bearing her
burden, without an effort to conceal
from you that she feels it hard to bear;
but you, whose age is not grave,
whose heart has rejected experience,
whose mind has refused to learn the
kindly insight of advancing years—shrink
into yourself, poor aged butterfly;
feel that it is presumption to
call yourself her counsellor, and say
again—again, with a tremble in your
weakened voice, “What can I do for
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aunt, I apply to you,” said Menie
Laurie; “I ask your help, when
I resolve to decide my future life according
to my own will and conviction
of what is best. I have no one
else to assist me. I apply to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Annie melted into a fit of
feeble crying; her hands shook, her
ringlets drooped down lank about her
cheeks. “I will do anything—anything
you like; tell me what to do,
Menie—Menie, my dear child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was pitiful to see her distress.
Menie, whom no one comforted, felt
her heart moved to comfort her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will not grieve you much,” said
Menie gently; “only I beg you to
give me your countenance when I see
Randall—Mr Home. I want you to
be as my mother might have been in
other circumstances; but I will not
trouble you much, aunt—I will not
trouble you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Annie could not stop her tears;
she was very timid and afraid, sobbing
helplessly. “What will I do? what
can I do? Oh, Menie, love, you will
make it up to-morrow;” for poor Miss
Annie knew no way of conquering
grief except by flying out of its
sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Menie led her back to the house
tenderly. Menie had never known
before this necessity of becoming comforter,
when she had so much need to
be comforted. It was best for her—it
gave her all the greater command
over her own heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>And to hear poor innocent July, in
her own young unclouded joy—to
hear her unsuspicious mother at their
breakfast-table—to have Randall’s
name cross her now and then, like a
sudden blow—Randall, Randall;—Menie
knew nothing of all these
depths, nor how such sorrows come
in battalions; so, one by one, her inexperienced
heart gained acquaintance
with them now,—gained acquaintance
with that sorest of human
truths, that it is possible to love and
to condemn—possible to part, and
know that parting is the best—yet
withal to cling and cling, and hold,
with the saddest gripe of tenderness,
the heart from which you part. Poor
Menie! they said she looked very dark
and heavy; that last night’s exertions
had wearied her—it was very true.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Annie sent a message that she
was not well, and would breakfast in
her own room. In the forenoon, when
she came down stairs again, even
Menie was startled at the change.
Miss Annie’s ringlets were smoothed
out and braided on her poor thin
cheek—braided elaborately with a
care and study worthy of something
more important; her step tottered a
little; when any one spoke to her, a
little gush of tears came to her eyes;
but, notwithstanding, there was a
solemnity and importance in the hush
of Miss Annie’s manner, which no one
had ever seen in her before. Half-a-dozen
times that day she asked, in a
startling whisper, “Menie, when is
he to come?” Poor Menie, sick at
heart, could scarcely bear this slow
prolonging of her pain.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p class='c020'>“Aunt, he has come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>No one knows; July is out on a
ramble in this pleasant heath, where
she cannot lose herself; Mrs Laurie
has gone out for some private errands
of her own. In her first day, Menie
has managed well. True, they all
know that Menie has been wearied
last night; that her eye looks dull
and heavy; that her cheek has lost its
slight bloom of colour; that she says
something of a headache; but nobody
knows that headache has come to
be with Menie Laurie as with many
another, only a softer word for heartache—no
one suspects that the quiet
heart, which feared no evil when this
spring began, is now a battle-ground,
and field of contest, and that sometimes,
when she sits quiet in outward
seeming, she could leap up with a
start and scream, and feels as if madness
would come to her underneath
their unsuspicious eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aunt, he has come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Annie Laurie is very nervous;
she has to be supported on Menie’s
arm as they go down stairs. “You
will make it all up, Menie; yes, my
darling;” but Miss Annie’s head nods
spasmodically, and there is a terrified
troubled expression about her face,
which looks so meagre in its outline
under that braided hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>Slightly disturbed, something haughty,
rather wondering what Menie has
got to say for herself, Randall sits
waiting in the drawing-room. It is
no small surprise to him to see Miss
Annie—especially to see her so moved
and nervous; and Randall restrains,
with visible displeasure, the words
which rose to his lips on Menie’s entrance,
and coldly makes his bow to
the lady of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Mr Home, I am very
much grieved; I hope you are ready
to make it all up,” murmurs Miss
Annie; but she trembles so much
that it is not easy to hear what she
says, except the last words, which
flush Randall’s cheek with a sudden
disdainful anger. A lovers’ quarrel!—that
he should be fancied capable of
this.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My aunt has come with me,”
said Menie steadily, “to give the
weight of her presence to what I say.
Randall, I do not pretend that my
own feelings are changed, or that I
have ceased to care for you. I do
not need to seem to quarrel, or to call
you by a less familiar name. We
know the reason both of us; there is
no use for discussing it—and I have
come to have it mutually understood
that our engagement is broken. We
will go away very soon. I came to
say good-by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before she concluded, Menie had
bent her head, and cast down her
wavering eyes upon Miss Annie’s
hand, which she held firmly in her
own. Her voice was very low, her
words quick and hurried; she stood
beside Miss Annie’s chair, holding
fast, and twining in her own Miss
Annie’s nervous fingers; but she did
not venture to look up to meet Randall’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does this mean? it is mere
trifling, Menie,” said Randall impatiently.
“You hear a gossip’s story
of something I said; true or false, it
did not affect you—it had no bearing
on you; you know very well that nothing
has happened to make you less
precious to me—that nothing can happen
which will ever change my heart.
Menie, this is the second time; is this
the conduct I have a right to expect
from you? Deal with me frankly; I
have a title to it. What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My darling, he will make it up,”
said Miss Annie, with a little overflow
of tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Menie was very steady—so
strange, so strange—she grew into a
startling acquaintance with herself in
these few hours. Who could have
thought there were so many passionate
impulses in Menie Laurie’s quiet
heart?</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will not discuss it, Randall,”
she said again; “let us simply conclude
that it is best for both of us to
withdraw. Perhaps you will be better
content if I speak more strongly,”
she continued, with a little trembling
vehemence, born of her weakness, “if
I say it is impossible—impossible—you
understand the word—to restore
the state of mind, the hope, the trust,
and confidence that are past. No—let
us have no explanation—I cannot
bear it, Randall. Do we not understand
each other already? Nothing
but parting is possible for us—for me.
I think I am saying what I mean to
say—good-by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at me, Menie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is hard to do it—hard to lift up
those eyes, so full of tears—hard to
see his lips quiver—hard to see the
love in his face; but Menie’s eyes fall
when they have endured this momentary
ordeal; and again she holds out
her hand and says, “Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-by—I answer you,” said
Randall, wringing her hand, and
throwing it out of his grasp. “Good-by—you
are disloyal, Menie, disloyal
to Nature and to me; some time you
will remember this; now I bid you
farewell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Something crossed her like an angry breath—something
rang in her ears,
confused and echoing like the first
drops of a thunder-shower; and Menie
can see nothing in all the world but
Miss Annie weeping upon her hand,
and, like a culprit, steals away—steals
away, not knowing where she goes—desolate,
guilty, forsaken, feeling as
if she had done some grievous wrong,
and was for ever shut out from peace
or comfort in this weary world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes—there is no one to see you.
Lie down upon the ground, Menie
Laurie—down, down, where you can
be no lower, and cover your eyes from
the cheerful light. How they pour
upon you, these dreadful doubts and
suspicions of yourself!—wisely—wisely—what
should make it wise, this
thing you have done? You yourself
have little wisdom, and you took no
counsel. If it was not wise, what
then?—it is done, and there is nothing
for it now but to be content.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p class='c020'>“It must not be—I cannot permit
it,” said Mrs Laurie. “Menie, is this
all that your mother deserves at your
hands? to take such a step as this
without even telling me—without giving
me an opportunity of remonstrance?
Menie! Menie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And with hasty steps Mrs Laurie
paces backward and forward the narrow
room. Beside the window, very
pale, Menie stands with a half-averted
face, saying nothing—very pale—and
there is a sullen suffering in Menie
Laurie’s darkened face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot have it—I will not permit
it”—Mrs Laurie is much excited.
“My own honour is compromised; it
will be said it is I who have separated
you. Menie! it is strange that you
should show so little regard either to
Randall or to me. I must do something—I
must make an effort—I cannot
have this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother, hear me,” exclaimed
Menie. “No one shall do anything;
I will not bear it either. In everything
else you shall make of me what
you will—here I am not to be swayed;
I must decide this for myself—and I
have decided it, mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With astonished eyes Mrs Laurie
looked upon her daughter’s face.
Flushed with passion, full of a fierce
unrespecting will—was this Menie
Laurie? but her mother turned aside
from her. “I am sorry, Menie—I
am very sorry—to see you show such
a spirit; another time I will speak of
it again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Another time!—Menie Laurie laughed
a low laugh when her mother left
the room. Something like a scowl had
come to Menie’s brow; a dark abiding
cloud was on her face; and in her
heart such bitterness and universal
disappointment as killed every gentle
feeling in her soul: disloyal to the one
love, disrespectful and disobedient to
the other—bitterly Menie’s heart
turned upon itself—she had pleased
no one; her life was nothing but a
great blot before her. She was conscious
of a host of evil feelings—evil
spirits waging war with one another
in her vexed and troubled mind. Sullenly
she sat down once more upon
the ground, not to seek if there was
any comfort in the heavens above or
the earth beneath, but to brood upon
her grief, and make it darker, till the
clouds closed over her, and swallowed
her up, and not a star remained.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a certain obstinate gloomy
satisfaction in despair. To decide that
everything is hopeless—that nothing
can be done for you—that you have
reached to the pre-eminence of woe—no
wonder Menie’s face was dark and
sullen—she had come to this point
now.</p>

<p class='c009'>Like a thunder-storm this intelligence
came upon little July Home—she
could not comprehend it, and no
one took the trouble to explain to
her. Lithgow, knowing but the fact,
was surprised and grieved, and prophesied
their reunion; but no hope
was in Menie’s sullen gravity—none
in the haughty resentment of Randall
Home.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Mrs Laurie once more with a
troubled brow considers of her future—will
Menie be best in the Dumfriesshire
cottage, where no one will see
their poverty, or pursuing some feminine
occupation among the other
seamstresses, teachers, poor craftswomen
of a less solitary place? For now
that all is done that can be done,
there is no hope of recovering anything
of the lost income,—and Mrs
Laurie will not live on Miss Annie’s
bounty. She is anxious with all her
heart to be away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Annie herself has not recovered
her trial: autumn winds grow cold
at night—autumn rains come down
sadly upon the little world which has
had its cheerfulness quenched out of
it—and when Randall takes away his
little sister to carry her home, Miss
Annie looks a mournful old woman,
sitting there wrapped up by the early
lighted fire. These two or three mornings
she has even been seen at the
breakfast-table with a cap protecting
the head which is so sadly apt to
take cold—and Miss Annie cries a
little to herself, and tells bits of her
own love-story to Menie, absorbed
and silent, who sits unanswering beside
her—and moans to herself sadly
sometimes, over this other vessel of
youthful life, cast away.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Miss Annie Laurie never wears
ringlets more. Strangely upon her
conscience, like a reproach for her
unnatural attenuated youth, came
Menie’s appeal to her for help and
comfort. Feeling herself so frivolous
and feeble, so unable to sustain or
strengthen, Miss Annie made a holocaust
of her curls, and was satisfied.
So much vanity was relinquished not
without a struggle; but great comfort
came from the sacrifice to the
heroic penitent.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Jenny, discontented and angry
with them all, furiously now takes the
part of Randall Home, and wonders,
in a fuff and outburst, what Miss
Menie can expect that she “lightlies”
a bonny lad like yon. A great change
has taken place on Menie; no one
can say it is for the better—and
sullenly and sadly this bright year
darkens over the house of Heathbank.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p class='c020'>“You’re to bide away—you’re
no to come near this place. Na,
you may just fecht; but you’ve nae
pith compared to Jenny, for a’ sae
auld and thrawn as Jenny has been
a’ her days. It’s no me just—it’s
your mamma and the doctor. Bairn!
will you daur struggle wi’ me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Menie would dare struggle
with any one—neither command nor
resistance satisfies her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me in—I want to see my
mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can want your mother for
a day—there’s mair than you wanting
her. That puir auld haverel
there—guid forgi’e me—she’s a
dying woman—has sairer lack o’
her than you. Keep to your ain
place, Menie Laurie—muckle made
o’—muckle thocht o’—but you’re
only a bairn for a’ that—you’re no a
woman of judgment like your mamma
or me. I tell you to gang away—I
will not let you in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Jenny stood firm—a jealous
incorruptible sentinel in the passage
which led to Miss Annie Laurie’s
room. “Miss Menie, ye’ll no take it
ill what I say,” said Jenny; “there’s
death in the house, or fast coming. I
ken what the doctor means. Gang
you ben the house, like a good bairn;
look in your ain glass, and see if there
should be a face like that in a house
where He comes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Menie looked silently into the
countenance before her—the keen,
impatient, irascible face; but it was
easy to see a hasty tear dashed away
from Jenny’s cheek.</p>

<p class='c009'>And without another word, Menie
Laurie turned away. Some withered
leaves are lying on the window-sill—the
trees are yielding up their
treasures, dropping them down
mournfully to the disconsolate soil—but
the meagre yew-tree rustles before
her, darkly green in its perennial
gloom. Rather shed the leaves, the
hopes—rather yield to winter meekly
for the sake of spring—rather be cut
down, and rooted up altogether,
than grow to such a sullen misanthrope
as this.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Menie Laurie looks into her
own face; this gloomy brow—these
heavy eyes—are these the daylight
features of Menie Laurie?—the interpretation
of her heart? Earnestly
and long she reads—no lesson of
vanity, but a stern sermon from that
truthful mirror. Hush!—listen!—what
was that?—a cry!</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor is leaving Miss Annie
Laurie’s room—the cry is over—there
is only now a feeble sound of weeping;
but a shadow strangely still
and sombre has fallen upon the
house, and the descending step rings
like a knell upon the stairs. What
is it?—what is coming?—and what
did it mean, that melancholy cry?</p>

<p class='c009'>Alas! a voice out of a startled soul—a
cry of wild and terrified recognition—acknowledgment.
Years ago,
age came gently to this dwelling—gently,
with light upon his face, and
honour on his grey hairs. There was
no entrance for him through the
jealous door; but now has come
another who will not be gainsaid.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gather the children, Reaper—gather
the lilies—take the corn full in the
ear—go to the true souls where
thought of you dwells among
thoughts of other wonders, glories,
solemn things to come—leave this
chamber here with all its poor devices.
No such presence has ever
stood within its poverty-stricken
walls before. Go where great love,
great hope, great faith, great sorrow,
sublimer angels, have made <em>you</em> no
phantom—leave this soul to its toys
and delusions—it is a poor triumph—come
not here.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hush, be still. They who have
sent him have charged him with a
message; hear it how it rings slow
and solemn into the ear of this hushed
house. “There is a way, and it shall
be called the way of holiness; the
wayfaring man, though a fool, shall
not err therein.” Stay your weeping,
poor fool—poor soul; prayers have
gone up for you from the succoured
hearts of some of God’s poor. Unawares,
in your simplicity, you have
lent to the Lord. Your gracious
debtor gives you back with the grand
usury of heaven—gives you back opportunity—hope—a
day to be saved—lays
aside those poor little vanities
of yours under the cover of this, His
great magnanimous divine grace—and
holds open to your feeble steps
the way, where wayfaring men, though
fools, shall not err any more for ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll let you pass, Miss Menie, if
you’ll bide a moment,” said Jenny,
wiping her eyes; “he says it’s no
the fever he thought it was, but just
a natural decay. Did you hear yon?
she wasna looking for Him that’s at
the door, and He’ll no wait lang
where ance He’s gi’en His summons—pity
me! I would like to see him
coming the road mysel, afore I just
found him at my door-stane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The room is very still; through
the quiet you can only hear the panting
of a frightened breath, and now
and then a timid feeble sob. She has
to go away—knows and feels to the
depth of her heart that she must
go upon this solemn road alone;
but, with a sad panic of terror and
curiosity, she watches her own feelings,
wondering if this and this be
death.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now they sit and read to her
while the daylight flushes in noon—while
it fades and wanes into the
night—the night and dark of which
she has a childish terror—read to her
this gracious blessed Gospel, which
does not address itself alone to the
wise and noble, but is for the simple
and for fools. Safe ground, poor soul,
safe ground—for this is no scheme
of eclecticism, no portal to the pagan
heavens—and you cannot know yourself
so low, so mean, as to escape the
range of this great wide embracing
arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not done all that I ought
to have done,” murmurs poor Miss
Annie. “Don’t leave me:” for she
cannot rest except some one holds
her hand, and has a faint superstitious
trust in it, as if it held her sure.</p>

<p class='c009'>A little pause—again the fingers
close tightly upon the hand they hold.
“I never did any harm.” The words
are so sad—so sad—falling out slow
and feeble upon the hushed air of
this darkening room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I never did any good—never,
never.” The voice grows stronger.
“Does anybody think I did? I—I—I
never was very wise. I used to
try to be kind sometimes;” and in a
strain of inarticulate muttering, the
sound died away once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then again the voice of the
reader broke the silence. They scarcely
thought the sufferer listened; for
ever and anon she broke forth in such
wavering self-justifications, self-condemnings,
as these. But now there
is a long silence; strange emotions
come and go upon this old, old, withered
face. The tears have been dried
from her eyes for hours; now they
come again, bedewing all her poor
thin cheeks; but a strange excitement
struggles with her weakness.
Looking about to her right hand and
to her left, the dying woman struggles
with an eager defiance—struggles till,
at a sudden climax, her broken voice
breaks forth again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who said it was me—me—it’s
not me! I never could win anything
in this world—nothing in this world—not
a heart to care for me. Do
you think I could win Heaven? I
say it is not me; it’s for His sake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For His sake—for His sake.”
If it is a prayer that ends thus—if it
is a sudden assurance of which she
will not loose her hold for ever—no
one can know; for by-and-by her
panic returns upon Miss Annie. Close
in her own cold fingers she grasps the
hand of Menie Laurie, and whispers,
“Is it dark—is it so dark to you?”
with again a thrill of terror and
trembling, and awful curiosity, wondering
if this, perchance, is the gloom
of death.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is very dark—it is almost
night.” The lamp is lighted on the
table; let some one go to her side,
and hold this other poor wandering
hand. “Oh! not in the night—not
in the night—I am afraid to go out
in the night,” sobs poor Miss Annie;
and with a dreadful suspicion in her
eyes, as if of some one drawing near
to murder her, she watches the falling
of this fated night.</p>

<p class='c009'>A solemn vigil—with ever that tight
and rigid pressure upon their clasped
hands. Mother and daughter, silent,
pale, keep the watch together; and
below, the servants sit awe-stricken,
afraid to go to sleep. Jenny, who is
not afraid, goes about the stairs, up
and down, from room to room, sometimes
serving the watchers, sometimes
only straying near them, muttering,
after her fashion, words which
may be prayers, and dashing off now
and then an intrusive tear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still, with many a frightened pause—many
a waking up, and little pang
of terror, this forlorn heart wanders
back into the life which is ending now—wanders
back to think herself once
more engaged in the busier scenes of
her youth, in the little occupations,
the frivolities and gaiety of her later
years; but howsoever her mind wanders,
she never ceases to fix her eyes
upon the span of sky glittering with a
single star, which shines pale on her
through the window from which, to
please her, they have drawn the curtain.
“I am afraid to go out in the
dark;” again and again she says it
with a shudder, and a tightened hold
upon their hands—and steadfastly
watches the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last her eyes grow heavy—she
has fallen asleep. Little reverence has
Miss Annie won at any time of all
her life—but the eyes that look on
her are awed and reverent now.
Slowly the hours pass by—slowly the
gradual dawn brightens upon her face—the
star has faded out of the heavens—on
her brow, which is the brow of
death, the daylight glows in one reviving
flush. The night is over for
evermore.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now her heavy eyes are opened
full—her feeble form is raised; and,
with a cry of joy, she throws out her
arms to meet the light. Lay her
down tenderly; her chains are broken
in her sleep; now she no more needs
the pressure of your kindly hands.
Lay her down, she is afraid no longer;
for not in the night, or through the
darkness, but with the morning and
the sun, the traveller fares upon her
way—where fools do not err. By
this time they have taken her in
yonder at the gate. Lay down all
that remains of her to its rest.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<p class='c020'>The curtains are drawn again in
Miss Annie Laurie’s house of Heathbank—drawn
back from the opened
windows to let the fresh air and the
sunshine in once more to all the
rooms. With a long breath and sigh
of relief, the household throws off its
compelled gloom. With all observances
of honour, they have laid her in
her grave, and a few natural tears
have been wept—a few kindly words
spoken—a reverent memento raised
to name the place where she lies.
Now she is passed away and forgotten,
her seat empty—her house knowing
her no more.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Miss Annie’s desk, a half-written
paper—intimating vaguely that,
in case of “anything happening” to
her at any future time, she wished all
that she had to be given to Menie
Laurie—was found immediately after
the funeral. But some superstitious
terror had prevented her from finishing
it, far more from making a will.
Menie was her next of kin; it pleased
them to have this sanction of her
willingness to the inheritance of the
natural heir.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Annie had been rather given
to speak of her savings; but no
vestige of these savings was to be
found. She had practised this on
herself like many another delusion;
and saving the furniture of Heathbank,
and a profusion of ornaments
not valuable, there remained little
for Menie to inherit. Miss Annie’s
maid was her well-known favourite,
and had been really attentive, and a
good servant to her indulgent mistress.
Her name was mentioned in the half-written
paper, and Maria’s own report
of many conversations, modestly
hinted at a legacy. Miss Annie’s
furniture, pretty and suitable for her
house as it was, was not valuable in
a sale; and Mrs Laurie, acting for
her daughter, bestowed almost the
whole amount received for it upon
Maria, as carrying out the will of her
mistress. Having done this, they
had done all, Mrs Laurie thought, and
would now go home to live as they
could upon what remained to them.
Burnside, with all its plenishing,
brought in no greater revenue than
fifty pounds a-year, and Mrs Laurie
had two or three hundred pounds “in
the bank.” This was all. She began to
calculate painfully what the home-journey
would cost them, and called
Jenny to consult about their packing.
They were now in a little lodging in
the town of Hampstead. They had
no inducement to stay here; and
Menie’s face looked very pale—very
much in want of the fresh gale on the
Dumfriesshire braes. True, they
knew not where they were going, but
the kindly soil was home.</p>

<p class='c009'>When her mother and Jenny began
to take enumeration of the bags
and boxes which must go with them,
Menie entered the room. Menie
looked very slight, very pale, and
exhausted, almost shadowy in her
mourning dress; but Menie’s now
was a face which had looked on
Death. The conflict and sullen warfare
were gone out of it. Dead and
silent within her lay her chilled heart,
like a stricken field when the fight is
over, with nothing but moans and
sighs, and voices of misery, where
the music and pomp of war has so
lately been. The contest was over;
there was nothing to struggle for, or
struggle with, in this dull unhappiness—and
a heavy peace lay upon
Menie like a cloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a wee kistie wi’ a lock.
I set it by mysel for Miss Menie;
and there’s the muckle ane that held
the napery at hame; but I’m no gaun
owre them a’. I’ll just lay in the
things as I laid them when we came.
Miss Menie! gang awa your ways,
like a good bairn, and read a book;
your mamma’s speaking about the
flitting, and I can only do ae thing
at a time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are we going home, mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is nothing else we can do,
Menie,” said Mrs Laurie. “I suppose
none of us have any inducement
now to stay in London.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A flush of violent colour came to
Menie’s cheeks. She paused and
hesitated. “<em>I</em> have, mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bless me, I aye said it,” muttered
Jenny quickly, under her
breath, as she turned round with an
eager face, and thrust herself forward
towards the mother and daughter.
“The bairn’s come to hersel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs Laurie coloured scarcely less
than Menie. “I cannot guess what
you mean,” she said hurriedly. “You
did not consult me before—I am,
perhaps, an unsuitable adviser now;
but I cannot stay in London without
having a reason for it. This place
has nothing but painful associations
for me. You are not well, Menie,”
continued the mother, softening; “we
shall all be better away—let us go
home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The colour wavered painfully on
Menie Laurie’s cheek, and it was
hard to keep down a groan out of her
heart. “I am not come to myself—my
mind is unchanged,” she said
with sudden meekness. “I want
you to stay for a month or two—as
short a time as possible—and to let
me have some lessons. Mother, look
at these.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Menie had brought her little portfolio.
With some astonishment Mrs
Laurie turned over its contents, and
delicately—almost timidly too—lest
Randall’s face should look out upon
her as of old. But all the sketches
of Randall were removed. Jenny
pressed forward to see; but Jenny,
as bewildered as Menie’s mother,
could only look up with a puzzled
face. What did she mean?</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are not very well done,”
said Menie; “but, for all that, they
are portraits, and like. I want to have
lessons, mother. Once before, long
ago,”—poor Menie, it seemed to be
years ago,—“I said this should be my
trade. I will like the trade; let me
only have the means of doing it better,
and it will be good for me to do it.
This is why I ask you to stay in
London.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jenny, very fierce and red, grasping
the back of a chair, thrust it suddenly
between them at this point,
with a snort of emphatic defiance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ye’ll no let on ye hear her!”
exclaimed Jenny; “you’ll let her get
her whimsey out like ony ither wean!—ye’ll
pay nae attention to her
maggots and her vanities! Trade!
My patience! to think I should live to
hear a bairn of ours speak of a trade,
and Jenny’s twa hands to the fore!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And a petulant reluctant sob burst
out of Jenny’s breast—an angry tear
glittered in her eye. She drew a
long breath to recover herself—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jenny’s twa hands to the fore, I
say, and the bere a’ to shear yet, and
the ’taties to gather—no to say the
mistress is to buy me twa kye, to
take butter to the market! I would
just like to ken where’s the pleasure
in working, if it’s no to gi’e ease to
folk’s ain? I’ve a’ my ain plans
putten down, if folk would just let me
be; and we’ll can keep a young lass
to wait upon Miss Menie,” cried
Jenny, with a shrill tone in her voice,
“and the first o’ the cream and the
sweetest o’ the milk, and nae occasion
to wet her finger. You’re no gaun
to pay ony heed to her—you’re no
gaun to let on you hear what she
says!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reaching this point, Jenny broke
down, and permitted, much against
her will, a little shower of violent hot
tears to rain down upon the arms
which she folded resolutely into her
apron. But Jenny shook off, with
indignation, the caressing hand which
Menie laid upon her shoulder. Jenny
knew by experience that it was better
to be angry than to be sad.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would think with you too,
Jenny,” said Mrs Laurie, slowly.
“I could do anything myself; but a
bairn of mine doing work for money—Menie,
we will not need it—we will
try first—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother,” said Menie, interrupting
her hastily, “<em>I</em> will need it—I
will never be wilful again—let me
have my pleasure now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a thing unknown in the
household that Menie should not have
her pleasure. Even Jenny yielded
to this imperative claim. The boxes
were piled up again in Jenny’s little
bedchamber. Jenny herself, able to
do nothing else, set to knitting stockings
with great devotion. “I’ll ha’e
plenty to do when we get hame,
without ever taking wires in my
hand,” said Jenny. “Nae doubt it’s
just a providence to let me lay up as
mony as will serve.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Their parlour was in the first floor,
over one of the trim little ladies’
shops, which have their particular
abode in little towns of competence
and gentility. Toys and Berlin wool—a
prim, neat, gentle Miss Middleton
sitting at work on some pretty
bit of many-coloured industry behind
the orderly counter—gay patterns
and specimens about—little carts and
carriages, and locomotive animals
upon the floor—bats, balls, drums,
shining tin breastplates, and glorious
swords hanging by the door, and a
linen awning without, throwing the
little shop into pleasant shade. This
was the ground floor; above it was a
very orderly parlour, and the sun
came glistening in upon the little
stand of flowers through the bright
small panes of the old-fashioned window,
and fell upon Mrs Laurie, always
at work upon some making or
mending—upon Jenny’s abrupt exits
and entrances—her keen grey eyes
and shining ‘wires,’ the latter of which
were so nobly independent of any
guidance from the former—and upon
Menie’s heavy meditations, and
Menie’s daily toil.</p>

<p class='c009'>For toil it came to be, exalted from
the young lady’s accomplishment to
the artist’s labour. She worked at
this which she harshly called her
trade with great zeal and perseverance.
Even herself did not know
how deficient she was till now; but
Menie worked bravely in her apprenticeship,
and with good hope.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<p class='c020'>“I wouldna ha’e come hame as I
gaed away, if I had been you, Jenny.”
The speaker stands at the door of
Jenny’s little byre, looking on, while
Jenny milks her favourite cow. “Ye
see what Nelly Panton’s done for
hersel; there’s naething like making
up folk’s mind to gang through wi’ a’
thing; and you see Nelly’s gotten a
man away in yon weary London.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldna gang to seek a misfortune—no
me,” said Jenny; “ill enough
when it comes; and I wonder how a
woman like you, with twelve bairns
for a handsel, could gie such an advice
to ony decent lass; and weel I
wat Nelly Panton’s gotten a man.
Puir laddie! it’s the greatest mercy
ever was laid to his hands to make
him a packman—he’ll no be so muckle
at hame; but you’ll make nae divert
of Jenny. If naebody ever speered
my price, I’m no to hang my head for
that. I’ve aye keepit my fancy free,
and nae man can say that Jenny ever
lookit owre her shouther after him.
A’ the house is fu’ ’enow, Marget;
we’ve scarcely done with our flitting;
I canna ask you to come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, Jenny rose with her pail,
and closed the byre-door upon Brockie
and her black companion. The wind
came down keen from the hills; the
frosty wintry heavens had not quite
lost the glow of sunset, though the
pale East began to glitter with stars.
Sullen Criffel has a purple glory upon
his cap of cloud, and securely, shoulder
to shoulder, this band of mountain
marshals keep the border; but the
shadows are dark about their feet,
and night falls, clear and cold, upon
the darkened grass, and trees that
stir their branches faintly in the wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>The scene is strangely changed.
Heaths of other nature than the peaceful
heath of Hampstead lie dark under
the paling skies, not very far away;
and the heather is brown on the low-lying
pasture hills, standing out in
patches from the close-cropped grass.
Yonder glow upon the road is the glow
of fire-light from an open cottage door,
and on the window ledge within stand
basins of comfortable Dumfriesshire
“parritch,” cooling for the use of
those eager urchins, with their fair
exuberant locks and merry faces, and
waiting the milk which their loitering
girl sister brings slowly in from the
byre. It is cold, and she breathes
upon her fingers as she shifts her pail
from one hand to the other; yet
bareheaded Jeanie lingers, wondering
vaguely at the “bonnie” sky and
deep evening calm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another cottage here is close at
hand, faintly throwing out from this
back-window a little light into the
gathering gloom. Brockie and Blackie
are comfortable for the night; good
homely sages, they make no account
of the key turned upon them in the
byre-door; and Jenny, in her original
dress, her beloved shortgown and
warm striped skirts, stands a moment,
drawing in, with keen relish, the
sweep of cold air which comes full
upon us over the free countryside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m waiting for Nelly’s mother,”
says Jenny’s companion, who is Marget
Panton from Kirklands, Nelly’s
aunt; “she’s gane in to speak to
your mistress. You’ll no be for ca’ing
her mistress now, Jenny, and her sae
muckle come down in the world. I’m
sure you’re real kind to them; they’ll
no be able now to pay you your fee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me kind to them! My patience!
But it’s because ye dinna ken ony better,”
said Jenny, with a little snort.
“I just wish, for my part, folk would
haud by what concerns themsels, and
let me abee. I would like to ken
what’s a’ the world’s business if Jenny
has a good mistress, and nae need to
seek anither service frae ae year’s
end to the ither—and it canna advantage
the like o’ you grudging at Jenny’s
fee. It’s gey dark, and the road’s
lanesome; if I was you, I would think
o’ gaun hame.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldna be sae crabbit if I got
a pension for’t,” returned Marget,
sharply; “and ye needna think to gar
folk believe lees; it’s weel kent your
house is awfu’ come down. ‘Pride
gangs before a fa’,’ the Scripture says.
Ye’ll no ca’ that a lee; and I hear
that Miss Menie’s joe just heard it,
and broke off in time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m like to be driven daft wi’
ane and anither,” exclaimed Jenny
furiously. “If Miss Menie hadna
been a thrawart creature hersel, I
wouldna have had to listen to the like
o’ this. Na, that micht ha’e been a
reason—but it was nane of the siller;
she kens best hersel what it was.
I’m sure I wouldna have cast away a
bonnie lad like yon if it had been me;
but the like of her, a young lady, behooves
to ha’e her ain way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Weel, it’s aye best to put a guid
face on’t,” said Jenny’s tormentor.
“I’m no saying onything at my ain
hand; it’s a’ Nelly’s story, and Johnnie
being to marry July Home—it’s a
grand marriage for auld Crofthill’s
daughter, such a bit wee useless thing—we’re
the likest to ken. Ye needna
take it ill, Jenny. I’m meaning nae
reproach to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m no canny when I’m angered,”
said Jenny, setting down her pail in
the road; “ye’ll gang your ways
hame, if you take my counsel; there’s
naething for you here. Pity me for
Kirklands parish, grit and sma’! with
Nelly at the Brokenrig, and you at
the Brigend; but I canna thole a lee—it
makes my heart sick; and I tell
ye I’m no canny when I’m angered.
Guid nicht to you, Marget Panton;
when I want to see you I’ll send
you word. You can wait here, if you
maun get yon puir decent woman
hame wi’ you. I reckon I would get
mony thanks if I set her free; but I
dinna meddle wi’ ither folks’ business;
you can wait for her here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And, taking up her pail again rapidly,
Jenny pattered away, leaving
Marget somewhat astonished, standing
in the middle of the road, where
this energetic speech had been addressed
to her. With many mutterings
Jenny pursued her wrathful way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ye’ve your ainsel to thank, no
anither creature, Menie Laurie; and
now this painting business is begun,
they’ll be waur and waur. Whatfor
could she no have keepit in wi’ him?
A bonnie ane, to ha’e a’ her ain way,
and slaving and working a’ day on her
feet, as if Jenny wasna worth the bread
she eats; and the next thing I’ll hear
is sure to be that she’s painting for
siller. Pity me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Full of her afflictions, very petulant
and resentful, Jenny entered the cottage
door. It was a but and a ben—that
is to say, it had two apartments,
one on each side of the entrance. The
larger of the two was boarded—Mrs
Laurie had ventured to do this at her
own expense—and had been furnished
in an extremely moderate and simple
fashion. It was a very humble room;
but still it was a kind of parlour, and,
with the ruddy fire-light reddening its
farther corners, and blinking on the
uncovered window, it looked comfortable,
and even cheerful, both from
without and within. Mrs Laurie,
with her never-failing work, sat by a
little table; Menie, whose day’s labour
was done, bent over the fire,
with her flushed cheeks supported in
her hands; the conflict and the sullen
glow had gone out of Menie’s face,
but a heavy cloud oppressed it still.</p>

<p class='c009'>Conscious that she is an intruder,
divided between her old habitual deference
and her new sense of equality,
as Johnnie Lithgow’s mother, with any
Mrs Laurie under the sun, Mrs Lithgow
sits upon the edge of a chair,
talking of Nelly, and Nelly’s marriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nelly says you were real kind.
I’m sure naething could be kinder
than the like of you taking notice of
her, when she was in a strange place
her lane, though, nae doubt, being
Johnnie’s sister made a great difference.
I can scarcely believe my ainsel
whiles, the awfu’ odds it’s made
on me. I have naething ado but look
out the best house in Kirklands, and
I can get it bought for me, and an income
regular, and nae need to do a
thing, but be thankful to Providence
and Johnnie. It’s a great blessing a
good son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As there was only a murmur of assent
in answer to this, Mrs Lithgow
proceeded:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure it’s naething but neighbourlike—you’ll
no take it amiss, being
in a kindly spirit—to say if there’s
onything ane can do—There’s Nelly
gotten her ain house noo, and wonderful
weel off in the world; and for
me, I’m just a miracle. If there was
ought you wanted, no being used to a
sma’ house, or ony help in ae way or
anither, from a day’s darg wi’ Jenny,
to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mrs Lithgow did not dare to
go any further. The slight elevation
of Mrs Laurie’s head, the sudden
erectness of that stooping figure by
the fireside, warned the good woman
in time; so, after a hurried breathless
pause, she resumed:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would be real glad—it would
be naething but a pleasure; and I’ll
ne’er forget how guid you were to me
when I was in trouble about Johnnie,
and aye gied me hope. Poor laddie!
next month he’s coming down to be
married—and I’m sure I hope he’ll be
weel off in a guid wife, for he canna
but be a guid man, considering what
a son he’s been to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He will be very well off,” said
Mrs Laurie; “and poor little July
goes away next month, does she?
Has Jenny come in yet, Menie? We
have scarcely had time to settle in our
new house, Mrs Lithgow; but I will
remember your kind offer, and thank
you. How dark the night grows—and
it looks like snow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll have to be gaun my ways,”
said the visitor, rising; “it’s a lanesome
road, and I’m no heeding about
leaving my house, and a’ the grand
new things Johnnie’s sent me, their
lane in the dark. I’ll bid you good
night, ladies, kindly, and I’m real
blithe to see you in the countryside
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was gone, and the room fell
into a sudden hush of silence, broken
by nothing but the faint rustling of a
moved hand, or the fall, now and
then, of ashes on the hearth. The
bustle and excitement of the “flitting”
were over—the first pleasure of
being home in their own country was
past. Grey and calm their changed
fate came down upon them, with no
ideal softening of its everyday realities.
This sliding pannel here opens
upon their bed; this little table serves
all purposes of living; these four dim
walls, and heavy raftered roof, shut
in their existence. Now, through the
clear frosty air without, a merry din
breaks into the stillness. It is little
Davie from the cothouse over the way,
who has just escaped from the hands
which were preparing him for rest,
and dares brothers and sisters in a
most willing race after him, their
heavy shoes ringing upon the beaten
way. Now you hear them coming
back again, leading the truant home,
and by-and-by all the urchins are
asleep, and the mother closes the ever
open door. So good night to life and
human fellowship. Now—none within
sight or hearing of us, save Jenny
humming a broken song, on the other
side of the wooden partition, which,
sooth to say, is Jenny’s bed—we are
left alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Menie, bending, in her despondent
attitude, over the fire, which throws
down, now and then, these ashy flakes
upon the hearth—our mother, pausing
from her work, to bend her weary
brow upon her hand. So very still,
so chill and forsaken. Not one heart
in all the world, except the three
which beat under this thatched roof,
to give anything but a passing thought
to us or our fate; and nothing to look
to but this even path, winding away
over the desolate lands of poverty into
the skies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Into the skies!—woe for us, and
our dreary human ways, if it were not
for that blessed continual horizon line;
so we do what we have not been used
to do before—we read a sad devout
chapter together, and have a faltering
prayer; and then for silence and darkness
and rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Say nothing to your child, good
mother, of the bitter thoughts that
crowd upon you, as you close your
eyes upon the wavering fire-light, and
listen, in this stillness, to all the
stealthy steps and touches of the
wakeful night. Say nothing to your
mother, Menie, of the tears which
steal down between your cheek and
your pillow, as you turn your face to
the wall. What might have been—what
might have been; is it not possible
to keep from thinking of that?
for even Jenny mutters to herself, as
she lies wakefully contemplating the
glow of her gathered fire—mutters to
herself, with an indignant fuff, and
hard-drawn breath, “I wish her
muckle pleasure of her will: she’s
gotten her will: and I wadna say but
she minds him now—a bonnie lad like
yon!”</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>CHRONOLOGICAL CURIOSITIES: WHAT SHALL WE COLLECT?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Is knowledge, like Saturn, destined
to devour her own masculine offspring,
and leave only the weak to live to
propagate follies? If Common Sense,
the strong born, has escaped, it is because
Knowledge has been deceived,
like Saturn, with a stone, not very
easy of digestion, nor promising to
add much to her substance. But this
survivor, Common Sense, has the
effeminate yet numerous progeny to
contend with, who, with a busy impertinence,
multiply absurdities, and
put them forth under the glorifying
name of their parent, Knowledge. We
rejoice, therefore, to see a laudable
attempt being made to rescue knowledge
from the cramming in of uncommon
and worthless things, and to
substitute for the people’s use a knowledge
of “common things.” And we
hope an aggregate addition of the
bone and muscle of a little more common
honesty, and true genuine natural
feeling, will be the result of the
wholesomer food. The people have
been long enough imposed on by false
titles; or the “Useful Knowledge,”
the pretence of the age, has been exhausted,
and resort had to a very
useless substitute.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not long since that we read
the question and answer scheme of an
examination of a retired village school,
consisting of labourers’ children; one
of the questions being, “What is
chronology?” “What is its derivation?”
Answer, “Derived from two
Greek words,” &#38;c. Will any one
think that children so taught become
wiser or better? This may not be an
isolated instance. It seems possible
that chronology may become rather
too fashionable a study, and engage
a host of collectors of valueless nothings.
The neglected science has
certainly some arrears to make up.
Some few years ago we were authoritatively
told that “History” is nothing
but an “old Almanac.” Since
which time, History and her sister,
Chronology, have been discarded servants—out
of place, and glad to pick
up a few pence here and there as charwomen,
in all sorts of odds and ends
of corners, to sweep away time-collected
dust and rubbish. Their industry
seems likely to be rewarded at
last. A few of the old worshippers,
taking advantage of this exhaustion
of “useful knowledge,” benevolently
lend them a helping hand, and are
trying to persuade the public that the
dust was gold dust, or better than
gold dust, and the rubbish a treasure,
and advising that it should all be
swept in again—and where?—into
our National Gallery! and doubtless
their next step will be to appoint a
Parliamentary Commission, not so
much for the purpose of sifting it, as
of issuing treatises and lectures upon
the value and national importance of
this new-old treasure trove. So that
the public may look to this, that, instead
of having their eyes gratified by
the beauties of art, they will be disgusted
with its deformities; while
their heads will be so stuffed with its
history, as to leave no room for a
thought of its excellence, or a sentiment
to be derived from it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let not the reader be alarmed at
the very mention of the National Gallery.
We are not about to inflict upon
him the evidence in the Blue Book
respecting the picture-cleaning, the
doings and misdoings of trustees, the
“discrepancies” of opinions and statement
of facts, the faults of a system
which is inconsistently at once condemned
and recommended for continuance,
the labyrinth of question
and answer leading to no conclusion,
the blame here and the flattery there,
the unwilling admissions and unreserved
condemnations: most people
we see are perhaps inclined to believe,
in this instance at least, that a “big
book is a big evil.” We do not, therefore,
intend in this place to reopen the
discussion which made the subject of
our former papers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The difficulty under which the Commission
laboured was visible from the
beginning. The trustees had approved
of the cleaning. The task of very
decidedly condemning this approval
was naturally distasteful; therefore,
what is too evidently wrong is charged
upon a “system,” while the honourable
personages are praised and flattered
as if they had never had anything
to do with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The case must for a while rest where
it is, and we should have waited with
patience the leisure of our now busy
Parliament for its resumption, were
it not that a very grievous mischief is
left in the Blue Book, where it meets
with much favour, to be taken up and
made the key-note, the first and last
principle of every future discussion
respecting a national gallery. It
might be thought that, after thirty
years of its establishment, we should
not have now to come to the question,
what a national gallery should be.
But so it is. There has been as yet
no “fixed principle,” we are told,
upon which a national collection is to
be formed. We have no charge to
bring against the trustees on that
account; indeed, we rejoice that they
had no fixed principle, if by fixed
principle is meant such scheme and
system as we see pertinaciously and
insinuatingly urged upon the public
notice in parts of the evidence, and
more particularly in the appendix of
this voluminous Report.</p>

<p class='c009'>We give our reader credit for good
taste and common sense, and doubt
not he will think it sufficient that a
national gallery should consist of good
pictures—the best that are to be had.
But no: common sense is too unrefined
for this knowledge-age, and good
taste is of private purveyorship, and
of very little importance in forming a
public collection. However absurd
this may seem to be, we assure the
reader that it is an idea put forth
with a good deal of authority, and
perhaps no little presumption, on the
part of some of its advocates; we see
its dressing up into a substantial
image of magnitude, and mean to take
up the sling and the stone, and do
battle with it. There are always a
multitude of dilettanti who, loading
their memories with names, love to
talk with apparent learning about art,
and yet have little feeling for its real
excellences. To such, a history of art
is better than art itself. They would
make a national gallery a lumber-house
of chronological curiosities.
They have a perverse love for system
and arrangement: very good things
in their proper places, and with moderation,
keeping a very subordinate
position, not without value in a national
gallery; but the value is little
indeed, if put in any degree in competition
with what should be the great
primary aim—to gather together the
finest works of the best painters. The
chronological arrangement should be
the after-thought, arising out of what
we possess, not directing the first
choice. This whim of the dilettanti
school is not new with us. It may be
seen in the Report of the Commission
of 1836—and is repeated in the present
Report.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The intelligent public of this
country are daily becoming more alive
to the truth, which has long been recognised
by other enlightened nations,
that the arts of design cannot be properly
studied or rightly appreciated
by means of insulated specimens
alone; that, in order to understand
or profit by the great works, either of
ancient or modern schools of art, it is
necessary to contemplate the genius
which produced them, not merely in
its final results, but in the mode of its
operation—in its rise and progress, as
well as in its perfection. A just appreciation
of Italian painting can as
little be obtained from an exclusive
study of the works of Raphael, Titian,
or Correggio, as a critical knowledge
of English poetry from the perusal of
a few of its masterpieces. What
Chaucer and Spenser are to Shakespeare
and Milton, Giotto and Massaccio
are to the great masters of the
Florentine school: and a national
gallery would be as defective without
adequate specimens of both styles of
painting, as a national library without
specimens of both styles of poetry.
In order, therefore, to render the
British National Gallery worthy the
name it bears, your committee think
that the funds appropriated to the
enlargement of the collection should
be expended with a view not merely
of exhibiting to the public beautiful
works of art, but of instructing the
people in the history of that art, and
of the age in which, and the men by
whom, those works were produced.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There is but little said here in
many words, and that little based
upon an erroneous presumption. We
do not believe that the “intelligent
public” are becoming alive to “the
truth,” which is a fallacy, that they
cannot profit by great works without
having before them the previous failures,
experiments, and imbecilities
of the earlier practitioners in art.
If the public have any intelligence at
all, they will appreciate the “Madonna
de Sisto,” for instance, without
disgusting their eyes with such Byzantine
“specimens” as that shown to
Mr Curzon in the monastery, where
the monk in his strange ignorance
inquired if “all women were like
that?” Nor is the parallelism between
poetry and painting here fortunate.
For, besides that books may
sleep on shelves and not offend, and
pictures (for the purpose intended)
must obtrude themselves on the eye,
we do not see that Chaucer and
Spenser at all bear the relation to
Shakespeare and Milton that Giotto
and Massaccio do to the great masters
of the Florentine school. All
these were men of great, mostly independent
genius, worthy of galleries
and libraries for their own sakes.
But they are here placed as screens to
hide the chronological deformities behind
them. The “not merely exhibiting
to the public beautiful works of
art” would seem to infer, to give any
force to the passage, that not only the
painters Giotto and Massaccio had no
“beautiful works,” but that Chaucer
and Spenser were poor poets, having
no beauties, and no other or little
merit but that of being the warning
precursors to Shakespeare and Milton,
to enable them to eschew their faults.</p>

<p class='c009'>The committee very cautiously abstained
from defining any chronological
limits, for we are not to infer that
they are to begin with Giotto. However
they may consider him the
founder of the Italian school, the appendix
shows that the Byzantine and
very early Italian art (if to be obtained)
are desired specimens. “The specimens
more especially fitted for a gallery
of paintings commence with movable
paintings on wood, by the Byzantines,
representing the Madonna
and child, single figures of saints, and
sometimes extensive compositions on
a minute scale,” going back even to
the ninth century, and so to the earlier
Italian “influenced by Byzantine
art.” And more decidedly to show the
mere chronological object, it is added,
“In the case of works without names,
or inscribed with names before unknown,
the test of artistic merit must
chiefly determine the question of eligibility.”
Artistic merit <em>only in</em> these
cases, and then “chiefly” so that in
other cases names are everything.</p>

<p class='c009'>And all this is for the purpose of
instructing the people, not in art, but
in the history of art, which may be
quite well enough learnt from books
by the curious, or in some museum of
curiosities, better than in a national
gallery, where the real and proper instruction
would only be hindered by
the sight of things antagonistic to any
beauty. We do not doubt that this
idea, carried out, would lead to a pictorial
chronological mania, if it does
not commence with it, not unlike the
Bibliomania, ever in search of works,
only rare because worthless. Such a
national gallery as this scheme contemplates
would be the exhibition of
a pictorial Dunciad, in which we hope
the <i><span lang="la">veræ effigies</span></i> of the first schemers
and promoters would not be omitted,
that some future satirist may give them
also their merited immortality. Why
cannot a committee upon a national
gallery confine themselves to the objects
for the consideration of which
they are appointed, and not run needlessly
into the duties of an educational
committee, and talk of <em>instruction</em>, when
the preservation and advantageous
exhibition of the monuments of antiquity
and fine art “possessed by the
nation” are what they are required to
give their attention to? There is
enough to be done in the line pointed
out to them, and no need of bewildering
themselves or the public, led
astray by this <i><span lang="la">ignis fatuus</span></i> of a chronological
whim. We are weary of
the daily cant; everything is to be
<em>instruction</em>, works of art are to be
“specimens.” Michael Angelo, Raphael,
Correggio, are to be known only
by and as “specimens.” The “people”
must be ever in a worry of knowledge,
flying about from specimen to specimen:
it is for knowledge alone they
are to come to a national gallery—we
hear nothing of enjoyment, of an
indulgence in the repose of taste; and
we do sometimes smile, in turning
over the leaves of the Blue Book,
when meeting with much talk about
<em>instructing</em> the people, and turn our
thoughts for a moment to the happy
“specimens” of instruction the walls
of our or any National Gallery exhibit.
Is moral instruction or art instruction
to be gathered in by the
people’s eyes, with their astonishment
at “Susanna and the Elders,”
and that other Guido purposely purchased
as a companion to it, the “Lot
and his Daughters?” very costly specimens
of instruction, the one amounting
to £1680, the other £1260, and
neither thought very good specimens
for instruction in art—not that the severe
criticism upon Guido in the evidence
is quite to be depended upon. The
great flustering “Rape of the Sabines”
is not of very nice instruction, perhaps,
either in morals or art. There are the
“Three naked Goddesses” by Rubens,
to whom the caterers of public instruction
took the part of Paris, and threw
the golden apple, and a very large one
too;—what are their Flemish nudities
to teach? A stern moralist showed
his insulted purity by dashing one
offending specimen to atoms.</p>

<p class='c009'>We do not, however, profess to be
such purists as to desire an irruption
into the Gallery of a mob of mad Savonarolas,
not easily gathered together
in these Latter-day-Saints’ times,
knowing as we do the real why and
wherefore of collecting; yet we cannot
but smile at the pretence of instruction,
which is sometimes put upon moral,
and sometimes shifted to pictorial,
grounds. But there is a class of pictures
we could wish to see more sought
after—pictures of a pure sentiment.
It is true they are rare, in comparison
to those of a far other character; but
they are the most precious, and the
really improving. Nevertheless, at
once to get rid of this pretence and
sham of instruction, we would ask, to
whom are such works of sentiment
precious, and whom are they likely
to improve?—Certainly not the multitude,
who would look at them with
indifference, and pass them by. They
are precious to cultivated minds and
pure tastes: minds which, either from
natural dulness or evil habits, cannot
receive, or even admit, the perception
of common virtues, will be
altogether untouched by their pictorial
representations. Fortunately,
there are enough works of a simply
pleasing character, that excite little
emotion, and none of a high caste, so
that, to a certain degree, those may
be gratified, and receive a pleasure,
who will neither receive instruction
nor improvement from a national
gallery. And it is this modicum of
pleasure to all which justifies expenditure
for a national gallery. The
real, solid benefit, delight, and improvement
are very great, but they
are the luxury of the few.</p>

<p class='c009'>It must be that the multitudes go
to such an exhibition more from curiosity
than from any love of art. Nor
is love of art likely, in the first place,
to be there implanted; for, in most
cases, a certain love of art, commencing,
perhaps, with a mere love of imitation,
precedes taste—that perception
of what is good. If we were to
collect only for the masses, we should
have a very worthless gallery. Nor
would “the people” ever even learn,
from a chronological collection, that
history of art, which it seems, in the
opinion of the Commissioners, so desirable
to teach them. Art, which is
not valued for itself, will not, in general,
be valued for its history; and
without the love for itself, a knowledge
of its history is nothing but
pedantry. High art is a common
prate; it is in every one’s mouth, but
in very few hearts. It is not difficult
to find the “reason why.” High art
treats of high and noble sentiments,
of generous actions, fortitude, patience,
sublime endurance—all that is great,
and good, and pure—all tending to a
real “elevated taste.” If it be true
that “Similis simili gaudet,” the recipients
of delight from this High art
should, in some degree at least, be recipients
of these high virtues themselves.
It must be a large nature for
High art. Such a nature may not
always be good; but if it be large,
even if it be viciously great, it may
be possible that it will have a perception
of what is great in art, though it
may lose its finer qualities. But narrow
and utterly selfish minds are altogether
out of art’s pale. There are
degrees of narrow-mindedness and of
selfishness, and there is a condition
which may be free from these vices,
yet of no very elevated virtue. We
do not wish to put all our fellow-men
in the worst category, but we do
maintain that there is a general lack
of moral training—of moral habit—and
not confined to one branch of society,
which operates as a bar to the acquirement
of a real taste for art. We
live in too mercenary an age. There
is too great a worship of mere money—there
is cold calculation where there
should be feeling. The romance of
life is a term of contempt. What is
useful supersedes what is good. Take
classes with their characteristics, and
see if they be fit for the enjoyment of
the Fine Arts. The Parliamentary
class have established new maxims.
Expediency has taken the place of
honour, and perhaps of integrity. To
say one thing and mean another not
only meets with no reprobation, but
is justified and applauded. Statesmen
make sham speeches and false
promises; politicians bribe and are
bribed. Is it likely that <em>High</em> art,
whose essential being is good, great,
and noble, and, beyond all, truth,
should find a real love among such?
We deny not exceptions, we speak
of that which prevails. View the
large and important class, the manufacturing,
the great fabricators of
wealth—they are encouragers of art,
but of what quality? Shall they who
thicken their cotton goods with flour,
to give them a deceitful substance;
shall the common traders, who adulterate
everything, whether it be what
we put in our mouths or on our backs—nay,
to a fearful extent, even the
drugs, for lack of whose genuineness
miserable sufferers die—shall these,
we say, stand with delight before
the grand dignity wherewith Michael
Angelo has embodied our common
nature; or before the pure “Spozalitio”
of Raffaelle; or, to come to a
“<em>specimen</em>” in our National Gallery,
before the lovely countenance of the
pure-minded St Catharine, beaming
with every grace of truth, of love, of
faith, and of fortitude, that appears
too much natural instinct to have
the effort of strength? Will they,
whose pursuits are the material things
of a material world, stand for a moment
to receive one impression that
shall produce an unusual awful
thought, before the solemn miracle,
the “Raising of Lazarus” of Sebastian
del Piombo? No one will deny
that there is but little feeling for
works of this kind; and that there is
so little, characterises our utilitarian
times.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be as well here to notice
what is said in the body of the evidence
with regard to this chronological
principle. The questioning is not
very extensive, and was, perhaps,
purposely limited. J. Dennistoun,
Esq., is examined, and says: “The only
further observation I would venture
to make is the extreme desirableness
of something like an arrangement of
the pictures. I believe that is a matter
felt to be so important that it is
hardly necessary for me to speak upon
it. I think a chronological arrangement
in schools is desirable; but, in
the meanwhile, as that would be totally
impossible in the present building,
I think, as far as possible, an
arrangement of the pictures might be
made chronologically, without reference
to schools,—even that would be
a step.” We observe that Mr Dennistoun
subsequently, as if alarmed at
the chronological prospect, very much
qualifies this his opinion. To <em>Question</em>
5901, he says: “I have already stated
that I think they should omit no
favourable opportunity of obtaining
any monument illustrative of the progress
of art in any school, such as
pictures authenticated by signature or
date, and of sufficient interest to be
specimens of art of that period. But
I think it is desirable that they should,
in the first place, bestow their attention
and dedicate their funds to that
more particularly interesting and valuable
period of Italian art, which I
have already considered in the course
of my evidence.” This puts the chronological
arrangement happily a little
more in the background. As might
have been expected from the accomplished
and learned author of the
<cite>Dukes of Urbino</cite>, we find in Mr Dennistoun
a nice appreciation of the
immediate predecessors of Raffaelle,
but he has no very long list; he only
mentions twenty whose works should
be collected, not merely on account of
their historical relation to Raffaelle,
but for their merit.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one is more thoroughly acquainted
with the Italian schools
than Sir Charles Eastlake, both as an
artistic critic and historical scholar.
He is (<em>Q.</em> 6512) consulted with regard
to chronological arrangement. He
evidently fears the subdivisions of the
whimsical process. <em>Q.</em> 6515: “Would
you then propose to arrange the Italian
school in a chronological series as
a whole, or would you subdivide it
into separate schools?”—“I would
certainly not separate the schools
needlessly; but I would not take out
the finest works and put them apart.”
<em>Q.</em> 6015: “Then you do not approve of
having separate apartments for paintings
of the Venetian, Florentine, and
other schools?”—“I see no objections
to a separation, but I do not see that
there would be anything gained by
having a mere historical series independent
of merit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We rejoice to find that the influence
of Sir Charles, deservedly great, will
not tend to turning our National Gallery
into an hospital of invalids and
imbeciles. We now come to Mr
Dyce’s evidence. <em>Q.</em> 7471: “You
have also, in your published work,
made suggestions as to the mode of
carrying into effect the historical and
chronological principle in the arrangement
of the collection?”—“I have
touched on the subject very slightly,
though I have laid it down as a
primary rule in the formation of
the National Gallery, that the historical
arrangement of the works
should be had regard to.” <em>Q.</em> 7472:
“You insisted that an endeavour
should be made, as far as possible,
to show the origin and progress
of a school of art, independently
of showing the excellence of its highest
and most perfect works?”—“Yes.”
As Mr Dyce’s pamphlet, a <em>Letter, addressed,
by permission, to H.R.H. the
Prince Albert, K.G.</em>, may be considered
the first, and perhaps authorised,
movement towards the fully
setting up the chronological system,
we shall make it the subject of our
comments more at large; preliminary
to which it may be useful to show the
reader the number of painters in the
several lists furnished in the Appendix,
which, we are yet told, is imperfect—in
fact, deficient, by many omissions;
so that the actual lists—as the
mania of making fresh acquisitions
would become very restless and busy—would
be possibly doubled and trebled.
Sir Charles Eastlake, in his
suggestions in the Appendix, not very
strenuously, we think, notices the
object, keeping it somewhat subordinate;
and we discover here why Mr
Dyce has dedicated his letter, by permission,
to H.R.H. the Prince Albert.
“The idea of a catalogue of the masters,
who might sooner or later be
represented in a national gallery, has
occurred to many; but the actual formation
of such a list has only been
recently undertaken, according to a
plan suggested by His Royal Highness
Prince Albert, and for His Royal
Highness’ use. With reference to
that list, I may add, that the catalogue
of the Italian masters was prepared
by myself, and that relating to
the other schools by Mr Wornum. The
series cannot be considered complete;
there are probably both omissions and
redundancies; but it may, at least,
be taken as the ground-work for such
a guide.” We find the lists for this
chronological collection to contain
(the Byzantine curiosities not included)
one thousand five hundred and
fifty-five names, and it is probable
that as many more might be collected.
So that these specimens, if even confined
to one for each name, would
very soon exhaust the public purse,
and possibly so disgust the nation, by
their exhibition, as to cause a stoppage
of supply for a national gallery.
Seeing this array of names, Mr Dyce
may well add, when he asks, “What
ought a national collection of pictures
to be?”—“extensiveness will, I
think, suggest itself as one of those
characteristics.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We are not denying that catalogues
of this kind are of value—far from it;
they are parts of the history of Art;
but surely a dictionary of painters is
one thing and a collection of pictures
another. An army and navy list are valuable
documents, but would be rather
unwieldy national incumbrances if accompanied
by each individual’s portrait
at full length—especially viewing
the collection, as is the case with this
gallery scheme, “independently of
merit.” It may be well said, that it
is absurd to think of such a scheme
with our present building; and it
would be difficult to find a site of sufficient
area for these specimens by
thousands, and at the same time provide
for the increase at the present
ratio of art propagation.</p>

<p class='c009'>We proceed to consider Mr Dyce’s
pamphlet, or letter—happily not very
long—for we have seldom met with
so much serious nonsense in so few
pages. He blunders on the very
threshold of his work; for, as shown,
he makes extensiveness a characteristic,
whereas it must be but the accident
of finding good things to collect.
He considers it as a museum, having
evidently in view a collection of curiosities,
the thing above all others a
National Gallery should not be.
“Then, again, as every collection has
in view some definite purpose, the
systematic fulfilment of that purpose
on the most enlarged basis—in other
words, systematic arrangement, and
a <em>wholeness</em> or completeness in relation
to its particular purpose, seem
necessary to the idea of a national
collection.” Words, words, words!
all to envelop a commonplace truth
that no one need be told. Of course,
every man, woman, and child, having
a “purpose,” should suit the matter
in hand to it. If the man had
been destined to manufacture small-clothes
instead of writing about art,
he wouldn’t begin at the wrong end,
and stitch on the buttons before he
had cut out his shapes. Of course,
he would have had his arrangement
and his “chronological” measure too,
and not put the boy’s fit on the aged
father. There is no end to writing in
this style; there may be, if a writer
pleases, miles of verbiage before reaching
a place of rest or tolerable entertainment,
without any prospect of the
journey’s end. Then he goes on thinking,
and “thinks” what nobody ever
doubted: “I think we may assume
that a public museum ought to fulfil
its purpose” (so ought a pipkin)—but
more—“and, secondly, that the
objects contained in it ought not
merely to be coextensive with that
purpose, but illustrate it with the
greatest possible fulness and variety;
that is to say, the collection ought to
be at once extensive and complete.”
Extensive and complete—or we would
put it plainly, as with regard to the
pipkin, that care should be taken
that as much be put into it as it
will hold without boiling over, preserving
in the simmering every variety
in the broth—the meat, the
bone, the fat, and the vegetables.
Notwithstanding this his very clear
explanation, he immediately again
gravely asks, “But what are we to
understand by the completeness of a
collection of pictures?” The reply to
this question (a reply which may well
astonish any inquirer) “depends upon
the view we take of its purpose;” that
is, to pursue our illustrations, whether
the small-clothes be to be made for
grandson or grandfather; whether the
pipkin is to hold porridge for breakfast,
or broth for supper. “Now all,
I imagine, will agree, that the object
of our National Gallery is, to afford
instruction and enjoyment” (a discovery
which he very shortly annihilates,
by taking out the enjoyment,
and making the instruction doubtful);
“that it is, or ought to be, an institution
where the learned study art, and
the unlearned enjoy it, where <i><span lang="la">docti
artis rationem intelligunt, indocti sentiunt
voluptatem</span></i>; so that we have to
consider how that instruction and
enjoyment which the gallery is calculated
to afford ought to be provided
for.” Not a doubt of it. But why,
Mr Dyce, ride your poor hobby-horse
round this circle? Don’t you see you
haven’t advanced ten paces beyond
the stable door. In fact, you have
said but the same thing over and
over again; but you have taken out
of the pack-saddle a scrap of Latin,
which, however well it may sound,
and your own hobby may prick up
his ears at it, is really a piece of arrant
nonsense; indeed the reverse of it is the
truth; for it is <em>the unlearned</em>, of course,
who come to your lecture, that they
may understand, “<i><span lang="la">intelligunt</span></i>;” and
the learned, the “<i><span lang="la">docti</span></i>,” they who know
something about the matter, only who
can perceive, “<i><span lang="la">sentiunt</span></i>,” the “<i><span lang="la">voluptatem</span></i>,”
the pleasure of art. But we said
Mr Dyce would annihilate enjoyment,
and see if he does not do the thing,
and most astonishingly. After the
passage last quoted, follows: “Now,
if there be any, and at this time of
day it is to be hoped there are very
few, who think that the purpose of
the National Gallery will be served
by what in popular phrase is termed
‘a selection of the best works of the
best masters’” (we rejoice to find
so sensible a <em>phrase</em> is popular), “I
will simply beg them to apply their
opinion to the case of any section of
a national library to convince themselves
how utterly untenable it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the Curiosity Museum is a
Library, and a Museum of Curiosities
and a library are, <i><span lang="la">ergo</span></i>, moulded into
one—a National Gallery; whereas
the materials will not amalgamate,—not
one is a bit like the other. To
go on is really to get deeper and
deeper into the quagmire of nonsense,
the only kind of <em>depth</em> to be met with
in the whole pamphlet. It must sadly
have tired the patience of his Royal
Highness, if he did read it; and if
Mr Dyce wrote it with any view of
giving his Royal Highness a lesson in
the English language, which was not
needed, he has furnished as bad a
“specimen” as could be well met
with. But to the matter and the
argument:—“the best works of the
best masters” is as silly an idea, he
thinks, as to supply a library with
the best dramatists, Shakespeare, of
course, included. He is an advocate
for the worst, such as no one would
read—and why?—the very sound of
it is truly asinine. “Would such a
proceeding be tolerated for a single
moment? Would it be endured that
they, that any body of men, however
eminent, should possess the right to
withhold from the public any attainable
materials for literary knowledge
and criticism?”—for which purpose
Mr Dyce does not withhold this
pamphlet. His materials it is not
difficult to decide. It certainly could
never have been intended for knowledge
but under the greatest mistake;
supposing it then to be for criticism,
we take him at his word, and indulge
him accordingly, or, as he says, “in
relation to its particular purpose.”
But he is not satisfied yet; having
nothing more to say, he must say
that nothing in more words. He continues—“that,
in fact, they should
have it in their power” (that is, the any
men, however eminent) “actually or
virtually to pronounce a judgment on
the comparative merits of authors, the
accuracy of which could only be tested
by the very comparison which the
judgment has the effect of preventing.
Yet there is no difference between
such a proceeding and the restriction
of the national collection of pictures to
such works as might happen to be
considered the best.” What a circular
jumble of words is here!—“a
judgment on comparative merits” not
to be pronounced, not to be endured
to be pronounced, because such judgment
has the effect of preventing the
said judgment, which is here made at
once both desirable and undesirable.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reader sees how much nonsense
may be comprised in less than two
pages, for we have not advanced further
in the pamphlet. A library, to
be a good library, ought to contain
the veriest rubbish, even Mr Dyce’s
letter, because without comparison
therewith we shall never be able to
appreciate the styles of Swift, and
Addison, and Milton, nor Shakespeare’s
dramas, without ransacking
the “condemned cells” of Drury Lane.
And when at length, by these forbidden
comparisons, we have discovered
the best works of the best
masters, it is not to be endured that
“any men, however eminent,” should
prefer them to the worst, or at least
not give the worst equal honour. Our
letter-writer thinks he strengthens his
argument by quotations from the evidence,
which, if there be anything in
them, are quite against him, for they
tend to show that selection should be
of the best: thus Mr Solly is asked,
<em>Q.</em> 1855—“Is it your opinion the study
of these earlier masters is likely to
lead to a purer style on the part of
our own painters, than of the later
and more effeminate school?”—“Certainly.
I perfectly agree with the
questions that have just been put to
me, and I am not aware that I could
add anything to them, as I think they
comprehend all that I should have
thought of suggesting myself upon
the subject.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It would have been surprising if
Mr Solly had not agreed with questions
so manufactured by epithets—for
“purer” and “effeminate” make
an undeniable difference. The questioner
might as well have said, Don’t
you think good better than bad?
Don’t you think virtue better than
vice? This is a specimen of the art
of dressing up a false fact, to knock
down with it a true one; but even
here, according to the Dycian theory,
the only earthly reason for preferring
the purer is that it is the earlier; if
the effeminate had by chance changed
places with it, it would have had his
chronological post of honour.</p>

<p class='c009'>In his next quotation the pamphleteer
is intent on giving a blow to
his compeers of the English school.
Mr Leigh confirms Mr Solly’s view—is
questioned, <em>Q.</em> 1913: “You say the
more chaste works of the Italian
school—do you refer to an earlier
era?”—“I allude to that particular
period so justly referred to in the
questions put to Mr Solly.” <em>Q.</em> 1914:
“Do you mean the historical painters
who were contemporaneous or
prior to Raffaelle?”—“Yes.” <em>Q.</em> 1915:
“You prefer these to the schools
of Bologna?”—“Yes; it is a school
whose works we are exceedingly in
want of, to enable us to correct the
tendency of the English style towards
weakness of design, effeminacy of
composition, and flauntiness of colouring.”
But Mr Dyce has altogether
forgotten his own rule, that it is not
to be endured to give a judgment, &#38;c.—that
is, to pronounce what is good,
what is “best” and “of the best,”
and that if proved best, we have nothing
whatever to do with that accident.
We have just warned the public,
by showing the probable number
of specimens for this new “Old Curiosity
Shop,” to be called our National
Gallery. Page 18, Mr Dyce says,
“Still, if it be remembered that only
fifteen years after the commencement
of the Royal Gallery of Berlin it possessed
works of all classes, from the
rude Byzantine down to productions
of the last century, to the number
of nearly twelve hundred, we need
entertain no great misgiving as to the
possibility of forming even a very considerable
collection within a moderate
period.” The public, we hope,
do entertain a very great misgiving
of the consequences of so frightful an
inundation, especially as it is to begin
with the rude Byzantine. But as the
“rude Byzantine” may stand as high
art, or fine art, in comparison with still
more rude beginnings; and as antiquity
lore is ever increased as it looks
backward, and is not confined to
country, there may be cause for misgiving
whether there may not be an
attempt to ransack China and Japan
for new old schools—to discover picture
mines in Peru, for monstrosities
in paint and design; for all become
legitimate sources under the ever-growing
chronological mania, this
outrageous pedantry of the “The history
of Art.” And here the writer of
the pamphlet, having perhaps momentary
misgivings himself as to the quality
of the stuff to be collected, goes
backwards and forwards in oscillating
contradictions, from best to any specimens,
and from any specimens to best,
ending in such wise conclusion as he
generally comes to, that it is “best” to
get the “best” specimens we can, but
no matter whether we get them or not,
provided we get any. For he insists
that the one object is to have “a collection
illustrative of the history of the
art, and “(in italics)” the formation of
it must be undertaken expressly with
that view.” Moreover, “secondly,
that though it be desirable that all
works collected should be of the highest
order—that is to say” (he loves to
explain himself thus by duplicate)
“that every master should be represented
by one or more of his best
works, yet as such works are not
essential to the completeness of the
collection, considered as an historical
series, but serve rather to enrich it as
a mere assemblage of beautiful works,”
&#38;c. &#38;c. Can anything show more
his contempt of mere beautiful works,
as in no way being an object in collecting?
In fact, the whole pamphlet
is to recommend, if not to enforce, the
gathering together an enormous mass
of curiosity lumber, and building a
labyrinth of “Chambers of Horrors”
to hold them. And it must be taken
into account that this absurd, this
tasteless scheme, is not confined to
pictures. It is proposed, in most
views of our future gallery, that
statues are to be added, and architecture
is to claim its due share as one
of the Fine Arts; and where are we
to begin, and where end? Is statuary
to find its rude commencement
in the “Cannibal Islands,” its progress
in Tartary, its rise and deification
in joss-houses, Burmah furnishing
“specimens,” even the wheels
of Juggernaut moving slowly and
majestically to a new enthronement
in Kensington Gardens, or wherever
our grand, national, amalgamated
museum is to be? Pagodas will
yield up their deformities to the new
idolatry of chronological worshippers;
the old monsters of Nineveh will be
revived; and to prove Lord Jeffrey
to be right, that there is no principle
of beauty, many a hideous image will
in arrangement claim affinity to the
Venus de Medicis and the Apollo
Belvidere. Really, all this is but a
natural consequence of the first step
in the system. It is to be, not art,
but a history of art, to be shown by
“specimens;” nor will it do to bring
a brick even from Babylon as a specimen
of its architecture. The public
may rejoice in its ruin, or it would
have to be brought in bodily, and a
hundred or two crystal palaces added
to our wonder of the world; as it is,
there must be an “<i><span lang="la">hiatus maxime
deflendus</span></i>.” We should have architecture,
and “specimens” of architects
of all the several countries and
schools, as of pictures and painters.
The English progress would be delightful
to see. Holingshed says, that
within the memory of many in his
days, chimneys were rare; of course
we must have “specimens.” We
might go on indeed to weary the
reader with absurdities, and it would
only be following out Mr Dyce’s
chronological idea in all its collateral
branches; for, getting warm in riding
his hobby, his heated imagination
looks out for inconceivable vanishing
points, which recede as fast as he
finds them, till he sees in the unbounded
space of art, which he thinks
he has himself created, arts and
sciences flying about in every direction,
and crossing each other like so
many dancing comets. The reader
must look for a little incomprehensible
language and confused utterance when
Mr Dyce descends, having breathed
the bewildering gas of his extraordinary
sphere, to put his thoughts on
paper, and thus he writes: “What
I was going to say was in substance
this—that if the idea of a complete
museum of the fine arts involved the
illustration of decorative art, and of
physical science in its relation to art,
to an extent which, though not unlimited,
is nevertheless indefinite, if
the <em>vanishing point</em>” (the italics of Mr
Dyce), “so to speak, of such a museum
lies somewhere in the region of practical
science, one is immediately led
to consider whether, as the reverse is
true—viz., that practical science finds
its vanishing point in the region of
fine art—the true idea of a museum of
arts would not be that which embraced
the whole development of the
artistic faculty, and commenced, therefore,
on the one hand, with those arts
which are solely, or almost solely,
dependant on <em>æsthetical</em> science, and
terminated on the other with those
which are solely or chiefly dependant
on <em>physical</em> science. Such an institution
would start at the one extreme
from physical science, and at the
other from fine art; and these two
would meet and cross one another,
the influence of each vanishing and
disappearing towards the opposite
extremes.” So that, if there is anything
to be understood and unriddled
from this confusion of wordy ideas, it
is this, that these arts and sciences,
æsthetical and physical, do not meet
to kiss and be friends, but to cross
each other, and, having simply blazed
awhile in each other’s faces, to fly off
to their own vanishing points, more
distant than ever, disappearing beyond
the hope of that happy junction which,
nevertheless, it had been the whole
purpose of Mr Dyce’s pamphlet to
bring about, and which, perhaps, he
thinks he has brought about, or
intends to bring about, unconscious
of the impossibility which he has set
in their way.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lest the reader think we have
needlessly brought in this body of
architecture, we must again quote
Mr Dyce. He certainly, to do him
justice, does admit that specimens of
architecture may be too big; but if he
enumerates and measures his “fragmentary
remains” from the British
Museum and elsewhere, “models of
whole structures, or models and casts
of details,” “adequate to the great
purpose of exhibiting the development
of architecture, both as it is a
science and a fine art, in all the
various stages of its history,” and if
some genii could bring them all together
and throw the brick and
plaster down before him, we doubt if
his, or any known human agility,
would enable him to escape the being
buried under the dust that would be
made by the deposit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But secondly, there is a peculiarity
in the case of architecture which
deserves to be specially noticed. It
is this:—that the examples required
to illustrate the history of architectural
construction and decoration lead
us at once into the province of <em>practical
science</em> and of <em>decorative art</em>; and
thus the door is opened to a more
extended view of the contents of a
National Gallery of Art.” When he
told us in the commencement that
extensiveness was one of the characteristics
of a National Gallery, we
never thought of an extensiveness
that should have no termination.
The opening of this, his one door,
shows a wearying vista—but there
are so many doors to open to “complete”
his scheme, that it is past all
comprehension where he will find
door-keepers, or the nation means to
pay them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us imagine these ten thousand
chronological galleries built, and inhabited
by all the arts and sciences.
Who could preside over such a
seraglio of beauties and uglinesses?—who
could possibly know anything
about one-half of them? We should
doubt even Mr Dyce’s powers to
interpret their languages, which would
be wanted, considering that the object
in view is instruction in their history.
And yet Mr Dyce, in his scheme of
government for the National Gallery,
looks to some one “coming man.”
“Some officer should be appointed to
take charge of all business relating to
the National Gallery, to be responsible
for the immediate management,
and to whom the public should look
for the success or failure of the undertaking.”
He must be a very wonderful
man indeed: if Mr Dyce has any
such in his eye, he ought to have
named him; for no one besides ever
saw a man on earth equal to so much;
and if he is to be general instructor
too, he would be wondered at, as
when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“——still the wonder grew</div>
      <div class='line'>That one small head should carry all he knew.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Yet upon the appointment of this one
officer Mr Dyce again insists in the
conclusion of his letter, and under the
idea of his duty embracing sculpture
and architecture, as well as painting,
under which heads also are included
unlimited and undefined æsthetical
and practical arts and sciences.</p>

<p class='c009'>In our former articles on the National
Gallery, we advocated the appointment
of one responsible person;
in what then, it may be asked, do we
differ from Mr Dyce? Simply, that
we would confine his attention to one
thing which he might be able to know—to
the collection of pictures. Even
if it were thought desirable to place
statues under the same building, we
would put them under the direction of
a person specially acquainted with
sculpture.</p>

<p class='c009'>The interest of the nation has been
now awakened with regard to the
National Gallery, to the pictures only,
to their collection and preservation.
A national museum, such as Mr Dyce
and others propose, is far too large a
subject, to discuss which seriously
would be only drawing away the public
mind from that which is a pressing
necessity. As the system holds at
present, we are neither able to buy
pictures properly, nor to preserve
them when we have them. Mr Dyce’s
own experience in the art qualifies
him to speak upon this point, and in
justice to him we add, that, excepting
the times when the chronological
mania is upon him, he writes fairly
and sensibly; and we willingly add
his modicum of assent to the general
opinion, upon the matters which the
blue-book has brought before the public.
Indeed, in this pamphlet he has
two styles of writing: the pages
might be well thought the work of
two hands. Whatever relates to his
chronological scheme is redundant,
confused, and ambitiously laboured.
He does not appear very clearly to
know what he has to say. He is, we
suppose, in the midst of his theoretic
arrangements, as a painter of eminence
visited with some misgivings as to the
worthless trash the fulfilment of his
scheme would introduce. He writes
like one under an adopted whim,
against his first instincts, with the
verbosity of an untutored and awkward
advocate. When he knows
clearly what he is writing about, he
writes like other people.</p>

<p class='c009'>He successfully exonerates the
keepers of the National Gallery, those
appointed subsequently to Mr Seguier,
from much of the blame that had been
cast upon them. He shows that the
responsibility had been, for the most
part, taken out of their hands, with
regard to the purchase of pictures;
that the trustees superseded the
keepers, and were afterwards themselves
superseded by the Treasury as
to active operations. The Lords Commissioners
of the Treasury, from the
nature of their appointment, are sure
to be more incompetent than the
trustees themselves. It is in evidence
that the Lords of the Treasury had no
confidence in the trustees; nor, perhaps,
much in themselves. Therefore,
in 1845, when the trustees recommended
the purchase of the Guido
from Mr Buchanan, the Treasury do
not comply with the request unconditionally—they
require Mr Seguier to
be consulted as to the condition of the
picture; and also “two other eminent
judges of the merit and pecuniary
value of Italian pictures.” They even
point out the individuals for selection:
“Mr Woodburn and Mr Farrer might
probably be selected with advantage
for the purpose, or any others whom
Mr Eastlake might consider preferable.”
The Lords of the Treasury
then preferred the opinion of two
dealers in pictures to that of the trustees
or Mr Eastlake; the latter being
more competent than all the others
put together to decide upon the subject.
The only surprising thing is,
that the trustees, upon this slight
put upon them, did not resign their
appointments, which, if honourable in
other respects, were now marked with
the character of incompetency. We
have already strongly insisted that
picture-dealers should in no case
be consulted. They are too much interested,
and wish to keep up the
value (artificial) of pictures; and the
world knows too well the nature of
their trafficking, to place implicit confidence
in their decisions. We say
not that a judicious choice might not
be made of skilful and honourable men;
but looking to all times, and with some
knowledge of the temptations of trade,
we should be sorry to see the practice
of consulting dealers become a habit
or a rule. Take the case which has
occurred—the Treasury nominate
judges; at a subsequent meeting of
the trustees these very judges have
pictures to be recommended—are other
trading judges to be called in? In
that case decisions will have to go the
round of these dealer judges. They
will either be shy of pronouncing
against the interests of each other, or
be under the temptation to give each
other a good turn, or, at any rate,
keep up the market, which they themselves
supply. The public have of
late been let a little too much into the
secrets of picture trafficking, and of
picture manufacturing. Is there truth
in the exposure that an overbaked
would-be Raffaelle was spoiled for
that master, but would make an admirable
Correggio? With all the
respect we owe to individuals, we confess
that there is a strong resemblance
between picture-dealing and horse-dealing.
The habit of appointing
dealers as judges would certainly end
in a council of dealers, who would, in
actual operation, supersede all others.
The fiat of the Treasury transferred to
the fiat of Wardour Street. We are
glad to quote Mr Dyce on this subject:—“This,
then, is the present state of
matters. The right to entertain a
proposal to purchase any picture rests
with the trustees; the ultimate opinion
of its merits, on which the purchase
depends, is not theirs, but that of certain
‘eminent judges’ of such points.
The trustees decide what may be and
shall be purchased, if it be worth purchasing;
the eminent judges decide
whether it be worth purchasing, and
worth the money asked for it. It
may be said that this is an extreme
and exaggerated case; that the Treasury,
though reposing confidence in
the recommendation of the trustees,
might nevertheless think it desirable,
on several accounts, to have this recommendation
fortified by the opinions
of eminent judges. True: but as it
cannot be supposed that the trustees
would press a recommendation, in any
case, in the face of an adverse opinion
given by the judges they had summoned
to their assistance—in other
words, since they cannot make a recommendation
at all without both
summoning such assistance, and obtaining
a favourable opinion—it is perfectly
clear that the favourableness of
opinion they have obtained, not their
concurrence in it, must be looked upon
by the Treasury as the real warrant
for adopting their recommendation.
Nor, on the other hand, is it refining
too much to say that the <i><span lang="la">ex officio</span></i>
trusteeship of the heads of the financial
department of the Government,
not only annihilates the responsibility
of the trustees, but prevents the due
exercise of the control which that department
ought to have over their
proceedings.”... “If the trustees
were to be superseded in a matter
of such importance, they surely
ought to have been consulted, not only
as to the manner in which they might,
with the greatest advantage, avail
themselves of professional assistance,
but as to the class of persons who were
to afford it. But no discretion was
left to them; and who, let me ask,
were the ‘eminent judges’ fixed upon
by the Treasury? Will it be believed
that not only the class of persons, but
the very individuals chosen to give an
opinion, on which the purchase of
pictures was to depend, were those
who were in the habit of offering, and
<em>actually at the time were offering pictures
to the trustees for sale</em>? At the
very meeting (held February 2, 1846)
at which the communication from
the Treasury was read, I find the
trustees considering a proposal for
the sale of a collection of pictures by
<em>Mr Woodburn</em>, one of the judges nominated
by the Treasury. At the
next meeting (held March 2, 1846),
I find that “the trustees <em>again</em> took
into consideration the offer of a picture,
by Spagnoletti, for sale by <em>Mr
Farrer</em>,” the other “eminent judge”
recommended by the Treasury. So
that, in fact, the “eminent judges”
were by turns competitors for the
patronage of the trustees, and by
turns sat in judgment on one another’s
wares.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Constitutions grow—they are not
made. We never knew one from any
manufactory, paper-made, that could
hold together; yet we go on with the
conceit that we have consummate
skill in that line; we make ourselves,
as it were, sole patentees for all
people and nations, and wonder at
the folly of those who reject the commodity,
and yet we never attempt
the thing on a small scale at home, or
a large one abroad, but the result is
a failure. The School of Design is a
parallel case with the National Gallery.
The committee of management
of that school was in the same relation
with the Board of Trade as the National
Gallery with the Treasury.
The action of the body was stopped
if no official representative of the
Board of Trade was present; and if
present, the council felt themselves
to be a nullity. Yet the council
could not at once be easily dismissed,
for the Parliamentary grant was
voted for the council of the School of
Design. In 1842, therefore, this constitution
is remodelled. The School
is put “under the <em>management</em> of a
director and of a council, subject to
the control of the Board of Trade.”
But here again is a failure. The
council and director cannot arrange
responsibilities. The director resigns,
another succeeds: as before, there is
no working together. The constitution
has to be remodelled again. The
Board of Trade takes the management,
assisted by the artist members
of the old council. This fails also;
and at last that is done which should
have been done at the beginning—an
officer is appointed, “under the authority
of the Board of Trade, to superintend
and be responsible for the
business of the schools.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In our democratic tendencies we
are jealous of one responsible director;
and, on the other hand, with our
aristocratic tastes and habits, we devolve
upon men of rank and wealth,
solely on account of their rank and
wealth, duties which they are not
qualified to perform (and, we think,
the greater honour would consist in
their declining such positions), and
which, if in other respects qualified to
perform, they will not, simply because
it is not their distinct personal business,
and of a paid responsibility.
And thus it is that the really qualified
persons, eminent for their knowledge
in art, science, and habits of business,
are ever excluded. Can we be surprised
if there be perpetual failures?</p>

<p class='c009'>The best boon the trustees of the
National Gallery can confer upon the
nation, is to resign in a body. Surely
there is now little to induce them to
remain where they are, and as they
are. This step would compel the
Government to do what they have
found it necessary to do in other
cases—appoint a paid and responsible
minister; and, if it be thought worth
while to have a National Gallery at
all, to provide liberally the means of
obtaining it. It will never do, on
every trifling occasion, to have to go
to Parliament, and to be met in a
huckstering spirit. We must break
some of the shackles which the modern
utilitarian school is ever imposing;
we must learn to view the fine
arts as a constitutional part of the
liberal arts, which must be treated
liberally, if we would have them permanently
established.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must now return for a little
space to the subject which, in the
commencement of this paper, we proposed
to discuss: “What are we to
collect?” We shall make a great
mistake indeed, if we are led by Mr
Dyce as an authority, to pass contempt
upon either the works of, or
the admiration felt for, the genius of
the greatest men in art—if we put
chronological series in competition
with excellence. He overdoes his
part, and can gain nothing by such
language as this:—“Turgid, unmeaning
panegyrics of Raffaelle,
Michael Angelo, Titian, Correggio,
and the rest.” These “<em>and the rest</em>”
are such pre-eminently great masters,
that, in some shape or other, we
would have their works ever before
the public. Where we cannot have
originals, we would have copies, and
the best that either have been made
and can be acquired, or that can now
be made. We cannot think a gallery
perfect without them. We would
have a portion set apart especially
for copies of the best works, and also
for prints. In them we might have
the designs, and the light and shade,
the great and beautiful ideas represented:
and here we cannot but
lament, that the perfection to which
the art of engraving has been brought
should in this country be given up to
inferior and almost to worthless
things. Our engravings indicate the
public taste, the causes of the low
state of which we have already remarked
upon. If there be really a
desire to instruct the public—and
without instruction there will not be
an encouragement for a better devotion
of that beautiful art—let the
collecting the best engravings, whether
old or new, be a great object with
the purveyors of a National Gallery.
Nor would we have the grand works
to which we allude put away in portfolios,
but glazed, and hung upon
walls specially appropriated to them.
Let us have, at least, good things—the
best originals we can procure,
and the next best, copies, and engravings
of the best; and not waste time
and squander means in searching out
for chronological histories, the attenuated
deformities of the Byzantine
schools, the hideous performances of
those predecessors in art, who had not
yet acquired the knowledge of drawing
with any tolerable correctness.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are earnest to make this protest
against the chronological scheme,
and we hope it will be dissipated by
the general voice, because Mr Dyce’s
pamphlet seems to have found favour
in the eyes of the commissioners.
They almost adopt his language—or
at least, with little variation of phrase,
his argument, and his illustration.
They too speak of an “intelligent
public,” which has no existence as
to art, and is but the translation of
Mr Dyce’s Latin quotation, “docti
artis rationem intelligunt.” With
him, they snub the admirers of
“Raffaelle, Titian, and Correggio,”
and adopt his literary illustration,
and a very bad illustration it is, for
the rubbish of books in the world is
even greater in bulk than the picture
rubbish. Some of the book rubbish
may indeed bear affinity to art, and
come within the scope of the scheme’s
arrangement. The woodcuts of our
earliest spelling-books, of Jack the
Giant-killer, of Pilgrim’s Progress,
and the “specimens” heading last
dying speeches and confessions, may
yet be discovered with some pains,
and no very large cost, if a Parliamentary
commission would bespeak
Mr Dyce’s acceptable labours. How
gratifying to such collectors would it
be to trace the rise and progress of
that particular branch of the art now
so much in fashion, from the earliest
“specimens” of designs in popular
editions of Æsop’s Fables, to Mr
Landseer’s last costly print. Nor
should the old glazed picture tiles, that
used to amuse our early childhood,
when the glow of fire-light illuminated
the “animali parlanti,” warmed our
young affections, and heated our incipient
imaginings, be omitted. The
“intelligent public” might perhaps
hence learn not only a little in the
history of art and its progress, but
somewhat also of the history and
progress of cruelty, when they see
how much artistic labour has been
bestowed, and what a large price is
given, in our modern improvement
days, in getting up and in the sale of
that “perfect specimen,” Mr Landseer’s
“Otter Hunt,” where the poor
creature is writhing upon the spear
of the huntsman, and the howling
brute dogs are in sympathetic delight
with the human bigger brute than
themselves. It will be then not uncreditable
if the “intelligent public”
retrograde in their taste, and for once
agree with Mr Dyce in rather admiring
the attenuated and ill-drawn deformities,
which, after all that can be
said against them, were a less libel
upon man and brute than some later
and more perfect “specimens.” To
this extent the chronological idea
must go for completion, for Mr Dyce,
the favourite of connoisseurs and dilettanti,
will not allow them to stop
short of it. “Notwithstanding appearances,”
he says, “I do not imagine
the trustees of the National
Gallery ever seriously contemplated
the establishment of an <i><span lang="la">index expurgatorius</span></i>
of pictures.” Such opinions
he considers obsolete. We must have
all “specimens,” however bad; for
he says, in emphatic italics—“<em>The
collection can aim at no lower object
than to exhibit the whole development
of the art of painting; the examples
of which it consists must therefore
range over its whole history!</em>” The
“ςηματα λυγρα” of Zellerophon were
not of a more deadly character than
would the contemplated collection be
to all true notions of the Beautiful in
art—the collection of inhumanities,
the doleful horrors of saints and
demons, and worse and more awful
representations which preceded perceptions
of the Beautiful.</p>

<p class='c009'>We ought to be glad to learn from
any who know better than ourselves,
but we very much question if our
perpetual appeal to the practice of
foreign galleries, in the way in which
it is made, is at all a healthy sign.
We are not sure that some of the
examples we seek may not rather be
warnings. It is a confession of imbecility
and mistrust in themselves
of trustees and commissioners. Foreign
architects, foreign directors, and
foreign galleries, bear too prominent
a part in our blue-books and our
pamphlets. We are confident in our
own men, if not in the “intelligent
public.” We have men quite able to
devise galleries, and to know how to
fill them. The misfortune has been,
not that we lack men of ability, but
we do not employ them. And why?
Our governments have no better
taste, no better knowledge, no better
desires, with regard to the arts, than
the “intelligent public.” They have
never entertained serious views upon
the subject. In conclusion, we would
ask if the series of Hogarth’s pictures
have been removed from our National
Gallery, on which they conferred an
honour and importance of a kind that
no other gallery in Europe can boast
of possessing, with the object of forming
a chronological series of the British
school. We hope to see them
transferred to their old places. Our
National Gallery should not be deteriorated,
to give a grace to Marlborough
House, however much it may
want it.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>
  <h2 class='c002'>THE REFORM BILLS OF 1852 AND 1854.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The postponement of the second
reading of Lord John Russell’s new
Reform Bill, until a later, and it may
be a protracted period of the Session,
is suggestive of some important considerations.
It shows, in the first
place, that even the author of the
bill is by no means confident in his
power of carrying it through the
House of Commons, else we may be
perfectly certain that no departure
from the original arrangements would
have taken place. It shows, moreover,
that other members of the Cabinet—or,
we should rather say, the
members of the Cabinet collectively—do
not consider the provisions of this
measure of so much importance as
to justify them in allowing it to interfere
with the more immediate exigencies
of the state. In one sense of
the word, Lord Aberdeen and his colleagues
are thoroughly conservative.
They want to keep their places; and
they have no idea whatever of sacrificing
themselves through the impulse
of Quixotic gallantry, or of allowing
Lord John Russell’s pledges to imperil
their tenure of office. But they
have an obstinate and pragmatical
man to deal with, and cannot afford
to affront him. Without Lord John
Russell, the Coalition could not stand,
and therefore, in some matters, they
are compelled to allow him more
license than is agreeable to their own
inclination, or in accordance with the
interests of the country. Thus, they
not only permitted him to prepare his
measure during the recess, but they
gave it real importance, by introducing
it as a material part of the ministerial
programme, as announced by
her Majesty from the throne. At
that time there was no more probability
of a pacific settlement of the
Eastern question than exists just now;
so that every objection to the measure,
founded on the impropriety of exciting
internal agitation at such a crisis,
must have been foreseen. There was
still time before the development of
the measure, and the publication of
its intended details, to have postponed
it without any loss of credit. No
one would have blamed the Ministry
had they done so—even the most ardent
reformer could scarcely have
maintained that they were bound to
force it through Parliament, just as if
no war were expected, or as if the
country emphatically demanded it.
But Lord John Russell would not
consent to that. He was determined
that the whole details of his project
should be laid before the public; and
he accordingly did so in a speech
which fell flat on the ear alike of the
House and of the country. He fixed
a day for the second reading; but before
that day arrived, postponed his
bill until a later period of the Session,
with a statement that, even then, it
would depend upon circumstances
whether he should proceed with it or
not.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is not such conduct as the
country has a right to expect from
the ministers of the Crown. They
were entreated, both by friends and
opponents, not to bring forward their
measure in the midst of warlike preparations,
and in the total absence of
any demand on the part of the country
for an immediate change in the representation.
Those entreaties were
met by silly, bombastical, and vapouring
speeches about the sublime
spectacle which Great Britain would
afford to the world, if, while waging
war abroad, she applied her energies
to the remodelment of the constitution
at home! We need not pause
now to demolish that most pitiful pretext.
It has virtually been given up
by the Ministry; for they now acknowledge,
that the time originally
fixed for the second reading of the
English bill was not seasonable; and
they indicate, that if we should be
actively engaged in war on the 27th
of April, the bill will not be proceeded
with; so that the notion of the “sublime
spectacle” is thrown aside,
whilst the cause of the irritation, made
worse by the divulgence of the scheme
in detail, is still continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>No really united cabinet would have
ventured to act in such a manner. It
is in vain to tell us of concert and
cordiality, when the public measures
of one week belie the bragging language
used in that which immediately
preceded it—when bluster is followed
by postponement, and extreme recklessness
by an affectation of patriotic
caution. The prevalent opinion is, that
the bill will not be proceeded with;
and if the Ministry had said even so
much as that, there would have been
no occasion for any further discussion;
but they will not say it. Lord Aberdeen,
on the 9th of March, when urged
by Earl Grey to withdraw the bill altogether,
is reported to have replied,
that “the second reading of the bill
had been postponed by Lord John
Russell till the 27th of April, <em>in sincerity
and good faith</em>. Whether it
would then be proceeded with, depended
upon the state of Europe; for
no one could tell what a day or an
hour would bring forth. Government,
however, would act consistently with
the interests of the country, and with
a due regard to their own honour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We cannot predict what the Government
may do hereafter, but we
know what they have already done
with respect to this matter; and it is
our humble but deliberate opinion,
that they have neither consulted the
interests of the country nor their own
collective credit. We should have
been very glad, indeed, had they allowed
the subject to drop; for we
should then have been spared the necessity
of criticising their conduct.
But, threatened as we are, though by
no means agitated or alarmed by the
suspension of a most clumsy weapon
over our heads, we must take the liberty
of reviewing the proceedings of
these Dionysians.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us assume, which we really believe
and devoutly hope to be the case,
that, notwithstanding the professions
about sincerity and good faith, this bill
has been absolutely sent to limbo. Let
us look upon it in the light of a scheme
abandoned. That, however, cannot
acquit Ministers from the serious
charge of having played fast and loose
with the country, by embodying in the
Queen’s speech, at the opening of Parliament,
a distinct recommendation
of internal organic change, when war
was staring us in the face. They knew
then perfectly well that there existed
no probability of the settlement of the
Eastern dispute without a direct appeal
to arms; and it was their bounden
duty to have interdicted the mooting
of such a question at such a time. We
maintain, that no cabinet has a right
to countenance this species of deception.
No specific measure should be
announced by a Ministry, much less
recommended by the Crown, unless it
is seriously intended that it shall be
carried through, not at some indefinite
future period, but in the course
of the existing session. This is not
the first time that the country has
been annoyed by this indecent and
reprehensible practice, introduced, we
believe, by Lord John Russell, of
rash ministerial pledges. We do not
think that even a premier is entitled,
towards the close of one session, to
announce distinctly the ministerial
policy of the next, or to bind himself
by a specific pledge; for even a premier
is not allowed by our constitutional
custom to act autocratically—he
must carry along with him at least
the majority of the Cabinet. He cannot
accurately predict who may be
his colleagues at the opening of the
ensuing session—he cannot foresee
what events may occur or causes arise
to render a change of the intended
policy not only expedient, but necessary.
If a premier is not entitled to
do this, still less is a subordinate like
Lord John Russell; and yet we see
him, session after session, blabbing
about future schemes, and pledging
himself unconditionally to their introduction.
This is really intolerable,
and it is full time that the nuisance
should be abated. If the noble lord is of
opinion that, notwithstanding all which
we have heard and seen, he has still
power and reputation enough to head
an independent party—let him leave
the Cabinet, and then, as a plain
member of Parliament, he may pledge
himself to his heart’s content. But
while he remains a minister and servant
of the Crown, he is bound to
maintain the dignity of his position,
and preserve a due decorum, instead
of acting like a popularity-hunter and
a partisan.  Of late he has let himself
down woefully. We are not accustomed,
in this country, to see ministers,
while in office, engaging in literary
squabbles—and exposing themselves
to damaging rejoinders by
petulant paragraphs and absolutely
deplorable sneers. Their duty is, not
to write or edit gossip and scandal,
but to devote themselves, heart and
soul, to the affairs of the nation and
the service of their sovereign; and, if
they are not willing to abandon their
favourite pursuits, they ought at once
to withdraw. With less than this
the nation will not be satisfied; and
we really think we are acting a friendly
part to Lord John Russell to tell him
so, in as many words. If he doubts
our sincerity, let him ask the opinion
of his colleagues upon the point; and
we are ready to stake our existence
that they will be unanimous in their
agreement with us. We believe also,
that, if the question were fairly put
them, they would be unanimous in recommending
him, for the future, so
long as he is a member of the Cabinet
and acting along with them, to abstain
from that system of specific pledging,
the result of which, in the present instance,
has by no means tended to
raise them in the estimation of the
country.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it may be asked, why, when
the Ministry have postponed for the
present, and may abandon, the Reform
Bill, we should harp upon a string not
intended, for some time at least, to
vibrate in the ear of the country? To
that we reply that we have many good
reasons for doing so. The vibration
has already been made. If a man is
told that it was intended, by virtue of
a parliamentary act for which Ministers
were to be responsible, to make
some decided change in his property
or condition, but that, in respect of
certain external circumstances, it was
deemed expedient to allow him a respite—surely
he is entitled to use the
interval in examining into the nature
of the proposed change; and, if need
be, in preparing his defence. It would
perhaps be too strong a phrase to say
that we know what is to come—for
Lord John Russell is such an experimentalist,
so entirely dependent upon
suggestions from others, and so utterly
devoid of any fixed principles to guide
his own judgment, that no one can
venture to predict what his views may
be six months from the present moment.
As a constitution-monger, the
Abbé Sièyes was, in reality, less erratic.
But we know this—that his lordship in
1852 brought forward a bill for amending
the representation, which bill,
owing to certain circumstances which
we need not recapitulate, went to
limbo; and that in 1854 he has brought
forward another, bearing in no respect
any likeness to the former one. Indeed
the issue of Banquo and of Macbeth
could not have been more dissimilar.
No. 3, however, is a great deal
more sweeping in its innovations than
No. 2 (for we must recollect that
more than twenty years ago the noble
lord carried No. 1); and No. 4 may
be still more progressive. Heaven
only knows what we shall have proposed,
when the number of his Reform
Bills equals that of his Jew Bills, or
the volumes of his <cite>Biography of Moore</cite>!
He seems to think that the story of the
Sybilline books was written expressly
for his guidance and conduct, and that
he is entitled, after each successive
failure and rebuff, to charge the constitution
with an additional per centage
of radicalism by way of penalty.
He becomes louder and broader in his
demands whenever they are negatived
or postponed, and seems in the
fair way to adopt some of the views
of the Chartists.</p>

<p class='c009'>We do not say this lightly—by way
of banter—or in regard of general political
disagreement. We never, at
any time, reposed much faith in the
judgment or sagacity of Lord John
Russell; and, of late years, our opinion
of him, in these respects, has, we confess,
materially declined. We have
been, in our own sphere of action,
engaged in most of the political struggles
which have taken place within
the memory of the present generation;
and we trust that these have
not passed by without some wholesome
lessons. To change of opinion,
where honestly induced and through
conviction, every one is bound to be
fair and lenient; because, undeniably,
in our own day there has been a
great unravelment of social questions,
and mere party prejudice is no longer
allowed to be paramount. Perhaps
the only living statesman of eminence,
who cleaves to the old system, and is
inveterate in his addiction to party
intrigue, and what he calls “tradition,”
is Lord John Russell. Put him
into Utopia, and his first thought would
be how he might establish the exclusive
supremacy of the Whigs. He is
so much and so inveterately a party
man, that he seems to care little what
becomes of the country, provided only
that he, and his, sit at the receipt of
customs. He showed that long ago—not
in the days of his hot youth,
but in those of his pragmatic manhood.
He—the Whig Constitutionalist—characterised
the opinion of the
Upper House as “the whisper of a
faction;” and did not disdain the
violent and frantic sympathy of mobs
when such demonstrations tended to
his own particular purpose, or aided
the ascendancy of his party. Ever
since he has pursued the same course.
No man can tell when he is in thorough
earnest, or when he is not. He invited,
by word and deed, Papal aggression;
and, when the aggression came, he
started up at once, as an indignant Protestant
champion, and flung down his
diminutive gauntlet, in name of Great
Britain, to the Pope! And yet, at
the bidding of the Irish Roman Catholic
phalanx, we find this second
Luther a strenuous supporter of Maynooth,
and of the nunneries! Had
his ancestor John, the first Lord
Russell—who in 1540, and 1550, obtained
grants from the Crown of the
possessions of the Abbey of Tavistock
and the Monastery of Woburn—been
equally zealous for the protection
of convents, he probably would
have remained, as he was born, an
utterly unacred gentleman.</p>

<p class='c009'>The proposed Reform Bill of 1852
did not attract a large share of the
public attention, and that for two
reasons. In the first place, the country
was quite apathetic on the subject;
and in the second place, it was
introduced at a time when the Whigs
were tottering to their fall. Nevertheless,
it is a remarkable document,
inasmuch as we may conclude it to
embody the experiences and observation
of Lord John Russell upon the
working of our representative system
during a period of exactly twenty
years. That there should have been
some defects in the machinery of the
engine which he invented in 1832, is
not wonderful; nor can we call him
rash for essaying, after so long an
interval, to remedy these defects according
to the best of his judgment.
His position in 1852 was this:—He
told the House, that he, the mechanist
of 1832, was now prepared, from
the results of twenty years’ observation,
to introduce certain improvements
which would have the effect,
for a long time coming, of preventing
the necessity of any further change.
The improvements he proposed were
these:—The qualification in towns
was to be reduced from £10 to £5;
and in counties from £50 to £20.
Every man paying 40s. a-year of
direct taxes was to be entitled to
vote. There was to be no disfranchisement
of boroughs, but the
smaller ones were to receive an infusion
of fresh blood by the incorporation
of adjoining villages. No property
qualification was to be required
for members, and the parliamentary
oaths were to be modified, so as to
allow the admission of Jews and
other unbelievers in the Christian
faith. Such were the chief features
of the proposed measure of 1852, as
laid before the House of Commons by
Lord John Russell, then Prime Minister.
Wise or unwise, they were the
conclusions which he had formed as
to the change necessary to be made
in the English representative system;
and we must assume that he had not
formed them without due thought and
matured investigation. That both the
necessity for, and the nature of the
change were seriously considered by
him and his colleagues in the Cabinet,
it would be unfair and irrational to
doubt; and we must therefore hold
that the provisions of the bill were
regarded by them not only as wise
and salutary, but as the very best
which their collective wisdom could
devise.</p>

<p class='c009'>If, in 1852, this bill had been rejected
by a majority of the House of Commons,
Lord John might either have
remodelled it, so as to meet the more
obvious objections, or have again introduced
it, without alteration, for the
consideration of another parliament.
But it was not rejected by the House,
and its merits were never thoroughly
discussed throughout the country. It
was, as we have said, introduced at a
time when the Whig ministry were obviously
in the death throes, and in
February of that year they tendered
their resignation. The bill accordingly
fell to the ground before judgment
could be pronounced upon it. The
public at large seemed to care nothing
about it. There was no enthusiasm
manifested at its introduction, and no
disappointment expressed at its withdrawal.</p>

<p class='c009'>The scheme, therefore, of 1852, was
not only untried but uncondemned.
Nothing had occurred that could reasonably
shake the confidence of the
deviser in its prudence, correctness,
or aptitude for the necessities of the
country; unless we are to suppose that
he felt somewhat disappointed by the
exceedingly cold and indifferent nature
of its reception. That, however,
could not be taken as any distinct criterion
of its merits. We are not to
suppose that Lord John Russell, in
framing that bill, merely looked to
the popularity which he and his party
might attain thereby, or the future
advantages which it might secure to
them. We are bound, on the contrary,
to assume that he, being then
Premier, and in the very highest responsible
position, was acting in perfectly
good faith, and had embodied
in the bill the results of his long experience
and observation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, mark what follows. In 1853,
he again pledges himself to introduce
a measure for the amendment of the
Parliamentary representation; and redeems
his pledge by bringing out,
early in 1854, a measure totally different
from that which he recommended
in 1852! The great points of difference
are these: By the one, the
boroughs were to be preserved, and
in some cases enlarged; by the other,
they are to be disfranchised to the
amount of sixty-six members. The
bill of 1852 maintained the distinction
between town and county qualification—that
of 1854 abolishes such distinction.
The first proceeded upon
the plain principle that majorities
alone were to be represented—the
second, in special cases, assigns a
member to minorities. In short, the
two bills have no kind of family resemblance.
They are not parallel,
but entirely antagonistic schemes; and
it is almost impossible, after perusing
them both, to believe that they are
the productions of the same statesman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing, it will be conceded on all
hands, has occurred during the last
two years, to justify such an extraordinary
change of sentiment. We
have had in the interim a general
election, the result of which has been
that a Coalition Ministry, numbering
Lord John Russell among its members,
is presently in power. Trade,
we are told, is in the highest degree
flourishing; and the prosperity of the
country has been made a topic of distinct
congratulation. Search as closely
as you please, you will find no external
reason to account for so prodigious a
change of opinion. The potato-rot
and famine were the visible reasons
assigned for Sir Robert Peel’s change
of opinion on the subject of protective
duties—but what reasons can Lord
John Russell propound for this prodigious
wrench at the constitution?
He cannot say that the proposals in <em>both</em>
his bills are sound, safe, and judicious.
The one belies and utterly condemns the
other. If his last idea of disfranchising
and reducing sixty-six English borough
constituencies is a just one, he
must have erred grievously in 1852
when he proposed to retain them. So
with the other provisions. If he intends
to maintain that he has now hit upon
the true remedy, he must perforce admit
that he has acquired more wisdom
in 1853 than was vouchsafed him
during the twenty previous years of
his political career. He must admit
that he was totally and egregiously
wrong in 1852; and he has no loophole
for apology on the ground of
intervening circumstances. Really
we do not believe that there is a
parallel instance of a British minister
having voluntarily placed himself in
such a predicament. How is it possible
that he can expect his friends,
independent of the mere official staff,
to support, in 1854, a measure diametrically
opposite to that which was
propounded in 1852? No wonder
that Earl Grey and other influential
Whigs are most desirous to have the
measure withdrawn without provoking
a regular discussion. Some of
them may not have approved of the
former bill; but those who did so, or
who were at all events willing to have
let it pass, can hardly, if they wish to
be consistent, give their sanction to
the present one. It is not Lord John
Russell alone who is compromised;
he is compromising the whole of his
party. If they thought him right in
1852, they must think him wrong in
1854; for he cannot point to the
smallest intervening fact to justify
his change of principle. And if they
think him wrong, how can they possibly
support him? We do not believe
that he can reckon on the support
of the high-minded Whigs of
England. They have principle and
honour and character to maintain; and
we think it exceedingly improbable that
they will allow themselves to be swept
into the howling Maëlstrom of Radicalism.
Rather than that, we venture
to predict that they will toss the rash
little pilot, whose incapacity and want
of knowledge are now self-confessed,
overboard, and trust to the direction
of an abler and more consistent member
of the crew.</p>

<p class='c009'>Be that as it may, we must try if
possible to ascertain what cause has
operated to produce this singular and
rapid change in the opinions, or rather
convictions, of Lord John Russell on
the subject of Parliamentary Reform.
As we have said already, there are no
external circumstances, either apparent
or alleged, to account for it.
The boroughs have done nothing to
subject them to the penalty of disfranchisement;
the counties have
done nothing to entitle them to a
considerable addition of members.
To use diplomatic language, the <i><span lang="la">status
quo</span></i> has been rigidly observed. Well,
then, in the absence of any such tangible
reason, we must necessarily fall
back upon motives, the first of which
is the advice and representation of
confederates.</p>

<p class='c009'>We at once acquit Lord Aberdeen
and the majority of the Cabinet of any
real participation in the scheme of Lord
John Russell. What may be the mind
of Sir James Graham and Sir William
Molesworth on the subject, we cannot
tell, but we are tolerably sure that no
other minister regards the bill with
favour. Even the members of the
Manchester party do not seem to consider
it as an especial boon. Mr
Bright knows well enough that a new
reform bill, if carried, cannot be disturbed
for a number of years to come;
and as this one does not come up to
his expectations, he is ready to oppose
it. Indeed, it seems to satisfy
none of the extreme party beyond old
Joseph Hume, who, for some reason
or other to us unknown, has of late
years been in the habit of spreading
his ægis from the back seats of the
Treasury bench over the head of the
noble Lord, the member for London.
The voice of the ten-pounders, as a
body, was not favourable in 1852 to
the lowering of the franchise; and we
have heard no counter-clamour from
the class who were and are proposed
to be admitted to that privilege. The
Whig aristocracy, naturally enough,
regard this bill with peculiar bitterness.
Therefore we do not think that
the astonishing change of opinion, or
rather of principle exhibited by Lord
John Russell, is to be traced either to
the advice of colleagues, or the influence
of more matured democrats. Our
own theory is this—that he never had,
as regarded improvements on the form
of the constitution or the representation,
anything like a fixed principle—that
he was striking just as much
at random in 1852 as in 1854; and
that, so far from having any settled
or original ideas of his own, he grasps
at any which may be presented to
him with extreme recklessness and
avidity.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are quite aware that it would
be, to say the least of it, gross impertinence
to make any such statement,
or to express any such opinion, without
reasonable and rational grounds.
We should be very sorry to do so at
any time, but more especially at the
present, when we wish to see Ministers
disembarrassed of all perplexing
questions at home. But it is their
fault, not ours, if we are forced to
make the disclosure; and to show
that, in reality, the grand mechanist
of 1832 had so forgotten his craft, if
he ever had a due knowledge of it,
that after his last abortive effort, in
1852, he was fain to derive new notions
from the pages of the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite>. In saying this, we intend
anything but an insinuation against
the talents of the author of the articles
to which we refer. We can admire
the ingenuity of his arguments,
even while we question their soundness.
We have no right to be curious
as to what section of politicians he belongs.
He may represent the philosophic
Liberals, or he may be the
champion of Manchester in disguise.
All we know is, that he has written
three plausible articles, after the
manner of Ignatius Loyola, the result
of which has been that poor Lord
John Russell has plunged into the
marsh, misled by the <i><span lang="la">ignis fatuus</span></i>, and
is at the present moment very deep
in a quagmire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some of our readers will doubtless
remember that, during the autumn of
1851, various pompous paragraphs
appeared in the Whig newspapers,
announcing that Lord John Russell
had withdrawn himself to country retirement,
for the purpose of maturing
a grand and comprehensive scheme
of Parliamentary Reform. The task
was entirely gratuitous and self-imposed;
for although the venerable
Joseph Hume, Sir Joshua Walmsley,
and a few other Saint Bernards of the
like calibre, had attempted to preach
up an itinerant crusade, their efforts
met with no response, and their harangues
excited no enthusiasm. Nobody
wanted a new Reform Bill. The
class which, of all others, was most
opposed to innovation, embraced the
bulk of the shopkeepers in towns,
who, having attained considerable
political and municipal influence, were
very unwilling to share it with others,
and regarded the lowering of the
franchise not only with a jealous but
with an absolutely hostile eye. It
was upon the shoulders of that class
that the Whigs had been carried into
power; and it really seemed but a
paltry return for their support and devotion,
that a Prime Minister, upon
whom they had lavished all their honours,
should attempt to swamp their
influence without any adequate reason.
It would be absurd or unfair to
charge them with selfishness. The
first Reform Bill, acceded to and
hailed by the great mass of the people,
had established a certain property
qualification for voters; and no one
could allege that popular opinion was
not sufficiently represented in the
House of Commons. Nay, many of
the Whigs began to think that popular
opinion was too exclusively represented
therein, and did not scruple to
say so. Anyhow, the Bill had so
worked that there, in 1851, was Lord
John Russell, its parent and promoter,
in the office of Premier of Great
Britain, and in the command of a
parliamentary majority. Small marvel
if the ten-pounders asked themselves
the question, what, in the name
of gluttony, he could covet more?</p>

<p class='c009'>They were quite entitled to ask that
question, not only of themselves, but
of the singular statesman whom they
had been content to follow. Could
he state that there was any measure,
not revolutionary, but such as they
and other well-disposed subjects of
the realm desired, which he was prevented
from introducing by the aristocratic
character of the House of
Commons? Certainly not. The
triumph of the Free-trade policy was
a distinct proof to the contrary. Was
there any discontent in the country at
the present distribution of the franchise?
Nothing of the kind. The
apathy was so great that even those
entitled to enrolment would hardly
prefer their claims. Even the enrolled
cared little about voting—so little, indeed,
that it was sometimes difficult
to persuade one-half of a large constituency
to come to the poll. All attempts
at public meetings, for the
purpose of agitating a reduction of the
franchise, had been failures. The people
were quite contented with things
as they stood, and grumbled at the
idea of a change. And yet this was
the time, selected by a Prime Minister
who had everything his own way,
for getting up a fresh agitation!</p>

<p class='c009'>Every one, beyond himself, saw the
exceeding absurdity of his conduct.
The leading Whigs became positively
angry; and from that period we may
date his rapid decadence in their estimation.
The real nature of his scheme,
consisting of an arbitrary lowering of
the franchise, was quite well known;
and as that could not, by any possibility,
be carried even through the
House of Commons, his own friends
thought it advisable to put the noble
Lord upon another scent.</p>

<p class='c009'>There appeared, accordingly, in the
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> for January 1852,
an article on “The Expected Reform
Bill,” which took most people by surprise
on account of its apparently
moderate, philosophic, and even Conservative
tone. It would be difficult
to analyse it—it is difficult, even after
reading it, to draw any distinct conclusion
from its propositions and argument.
But this, at all events, was
admitted, that “clearly there is no
<em>call</em> for Parliamentary Reform on the
part of any large or influential class.
There is no zeal about it, one way or
the other. An extension of the franchise
is wished for by some, and
thought proper and desirable by
many; but it is not an actual want
largely felt, nor is the deprivation of
the franchise a practical grievance,
clear enough, tangible enough, generally
recognised enough, to have given
rise to a genuine, spontaneous, exclusive
demand for redress. There is a
general languor and want of interest
on the subject, manifested nowhere
more plainly than in the tone and
character of the meetings got up by
the Reform Association for the sake
of arousing public feeling. <em>The nation,
as a whole, is undeniably indifferent;
the agitation is clearly artificial.</em>”
Then, again, we are told that “<i><span lang="la">Quieta
non movere</span></i> is, in political matters,
as often a maxim of wisdom as of
laziness;” and a great deal more to
the same effect, which could not have
had a very exhilarating effect on the
mind of Lord John Russell, supposing,
as we do, that he was in total ignorance
of the article in question before
it was given to the public. Certainly,
on this occasion, he had but a poor
backing from his friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>The view of the writer in question
seemed to be this—that instead of arbitrarily
lowering the franchise on the
footing of a property qualification, it
is important to discover some criterion
by means of which persons
morally and educationally qualified,
who have not the franchise at present,
may be admitted to that privilege.
We are not reviewing or discussing
the article—we are simply pointing
out the sources from which Lord
John Russell has derived most of his
new ideas. Therefore we shall simply
quote one passage from this article.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Source of Lord John Russell’s new
idea of the Savings’ Bank Deposit
qualification.</em>—“Our present system
is defective and unjust in this—that
it selects two kinds or forms of property
only as conferring the franchise.
Let us continue to maintain a property
qualification; but let us not
insist that the property, so favourably
and honourably distinguished,
must be invested in one special mode.
If a man has accumulated by diligence
or frugality £50 or £100, and
spends it either in the purchase of a
freehold, or in removing his residence
from an £8 to a £10 house, his realised
property confers upon him the
distinction of a vote. But if he invests
the same sum, earned by similar
qualities, in the savings’ bank, or in
railway shares or debentures, or in the
purchase of a deferred annuity—which
would probably be much wiser modes
of disposing of it—it carries with it no
such privilege. This seems neither
equitable nor wise. It might easily
be rectified, and such rectification
would be at once one of the safest,
simplest, justest, and most desirable
extensions of the franchise that could
be suggested. <em>Let the production before
the registration courts of a savings’
bank book, showing a credit of
£50</em>, of at least six months’ standing,
or of a <em>bona fide</em> certificate of shares
to the same value in a valid railway,
or of coupons to the same amount, be
held to entitle a man to be inscribed
upon the list of voters for that year.”—<cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite>, Jan. 1852, p.
265.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adhering to our original intention
of not discussing the merits of the different
proposals of this and the other
articles in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, we
shall not comment upon the unblushing
impudence of such a project as
this, which would place the representation
of the country principally in the
hands of millionaires and railway directors.
It <em>is</em> unparalleledly impudent.
But we notice it now simply as the
germ of Lord John Russell’s £50
savings’ bank qualification.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time this article appeared,
Lord John Russell’s Bill was prepared;
though no one expected that
it would be carried. The Whig party
were conscious that the hour of their
doom was approaching, but they
wished to bear with them into opposition
a weapon which might be available
for future warfare. Lord John’s
ideas had not then penetrated beyond
a lowering of the franchise and the
admission to the register of parties
who paid 40s. a-year of direct taxes.
These were his deliberate impressions
before the schoolmaster of the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite> appeared abroad.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this, Lord John Russell went
out of office; but the <cite>Review</cite> kept
harping on Reform. The writer had
already stated, “that a new measure
of Parliamentary Reform was demanded,
rather in the name of theoretical
propriety than of practical advantage.”
It seems to us that such
an admission was nearly tantamount
to an argument against the policy of
making any change at all; more especially
when we were told, nearly in the
same page, that “there was no <em>call</em>
for Parliamentary Reform on the part
of any large or influential class.” If
that were true, we should like to know
who “demanded” the new measure?
But we must not be too critical regarding
the advances of the new Lycurgus.</p>

<p class='c009'>In October 1852, a second article
appeared, the preamble of which was
very moderate—indeed, rather calculated
to impress the casual reader with
the idea that the author would have
much preferred if “the vexed question
of the franchise” could have been
left alone. Nevertheless it appeared
to him that there were “many reasons
which make it impossible either
entirely to shelve or long to postpone
the question of Parliamentary Reform;”
and, having stated these, he
dashes again into his subject. He is,
however, a great deal too knowing to
commence with the proposal of innovations.
He treats us to several
pages of high Conservativism, condemnatory
of universal suffrage; and having
thus established a kind of confidence—acting
on Quintilian’s advice,
to frame the introduction so as “<i><span lang="la">reddere
auditores benevolos, attentos, dociles</span></i>”—he
begins to propound his new
ideas. In this article we have:—</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Source of Lord John Russell’s new
proposal to swamp the Counties by the
admission of £10 occupants.</em>—“The
other plan is to extend the £10 qualification
to counties, by which means
<em>every</em> householder (to the requisite
value) throughout the land would
possess a vote; if he resided in a small
town or a village, or an isolated dwelling,
he would be upon the county
register. The only objection we can
hear of to this plan is, that in the
country districts and in hamlets a
£10 occupancy generally includes
some land, and would not, therefore,
indicate the same social station as the
living in a £10 house in town, and
that it might lead to the creation, for
the sake of augmenting landlord influence,
of a numerous and dependent
class of tenant voters. But in the
first place, the occupier of a £10 house
in villages and small towns belongs to a
decidedly higher social grade than the
occupier of a £10 house in cities; and,
in the second place, it would not be
difficult to meet the objection, by requiring
that the qualifying occupancy
shall be, in the county register, a
house, and not a house and land, or
by fixing a sum which shall, as nearly
as can be ascertained, be generally an
equivalent to the £10 occupancy contemplated
by the present law.”—<cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite>, Oct. 1852, p. 472.</p>

<p class='c009'>That is the second instance of
appropriation on the part of the wise,
ripe, deliberate statesman, who for
twenty years had been watching the
progress of his own handiwork with
the view to introducing repairs. Before
this article in the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite> appeared, it had never occurred
to him how convenient it might be
to swamp the counties, and how very
simple were the means of doing so!
Now for appropriation third:—</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Source of Lord John Russell’s proposal
to admit all Graduates of Universities
to Town and County franchise.</em>
“It is, of course, desirable, and is
admitted to be so by every party, that
<em>all</em> educated men shall be voters;
the difficulty is to name any ostensible
qualifications which shall include
them, and them alone. But though
we cannot frame a criterion which
shall include all, there is no reason
why we should not accept one which
will include a considerable number of
whose fitness to possess the franchise
there can be no question. We would
propose, therefore, that the franchise
be granted to all <em>graduates of Universities</em>,”
&#38;c.—<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, Oct.
1852, p. 473.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another hint adopted by Sir Fretful
Plagiary! Next we come to a more
serious matter:—</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Source of Lord John Russell’s proposal
for disfranchising the lesser
English boroughs.</em>—“The great majority
of them are notoriously undeserving
of the franchise, and those who
know them best are least disposed to
undertake their defence. The plan of
combining a number of them into one
constituency would be futile or beneficial
according to the details of each
individual case. If a close or a rotten
borough were amalgamated with an
open or a manufacturing town, much
advantage might possibly result; if
two or three corrupt or manageable
constituencies merely united their iniquities,
the evil of the existing things
would only be spread farther and rooted
faster. We should propose, therefore,
at once to reduce the 61 boroughs
with fewer than 500 electors, and now
returning 91 members, to one representative
each.”—<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>,
Oct. 1852, p. 496.</p>

<p class='c009'>We shall see presently that this
proposal was amended, as not being
sufficiently sweeping. Only thirty
seats are here proscribed; but it was
afterwards found expedient to increase
the black list to the number of sixty-six.
Pass we to the next instance of
palpable cribbage.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Source of Lord John Russell’s proposal
that Members accepting office
shall not be obliged to vacate their seats.</em>—“The
most desirable man cannot
be appointed Colonial Minister, because
his seat, if vacated, might be
irrecoverable. Administrations cannot
strengthen themselves by the alliance
of colleagues who possess the
confidence of the general public, because
the place for which they sit has
been offended by some unpopular
vote or speech. We need add no
more on this head: the peculiarity of
the case is, that we have no adverse
arguments to meet.”—<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>,
Oct. 1852, p. 501.</p>

<p class='c009'>The writer is decidedly wrong about
the non-existence of adverse arguments;
and we shall be happy to convince
him of the fact if he will be kind
enough to accord us a meeting. In
the mean time, however, he has humbugged
Lord John, which was evidently
his special purpose. Even while we
deprecate the morality of his proceeding,
we can hardly forbear expressing
our admiration of his skill. We know
not his earthly name or habitation;
but he <em>is</em> a clever fellow, for he has
led, with equal audacity and success,
the ex-Premier of Great Britain, and
the father of Reform, by the nose!</p>

<p class='c009'>But we have not yet done. The
article last referred to was penned
and published before the new Parliament
met, towards the close of 1852,
and before the balance and state of
parties could be ascertained. The
result of the election showed that
parties were in effect almost equally
balanced—so much so, that, but for
the junction of the Peelites with the
Liberals, Lord Derby would have obtained
a majority. The election, it
will be remembered, took place under
circumstances peculiarly unfavourable
to the Government; and never perhaps
was misrepresentation of every kind
more unscrupulously employed than
by the Liberal press on that occasion.
Still it became evident that Conservatism
was gaining ground in the country;
and it was a natural inference that,
after the question of Protection was
finally set at rest, its progress would
be still more rapid. This was not exactly
what the writer in the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite> had calculated on. He now
saw that it would be necessary, if the
Liberal party was to be maintained
in power, to go a good deal further
than he at first proposed; and accordingly,
when he appears again before
us in October 1853, we find him armed
this time, not with a pruning-hook,
but with a formidable axe. We hear
no more about “theoretical propriety”—he
is evidently determined upon
mischief. Now, then, for his developed
views, as adopted by his docile
pupil.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Source of Lord John Russell’s proposal
that freemen shall have no votes.</em>—“There
is no doubt in the mind of
any man, we imagine, that incomparably
the most openly and universally
venal portion of borough constituencies
are the old freemen, so unhappily
and weakly retained by the Reform
Act of 1832.... The disfranchisement
of the freemen is, perhaps, of all steps
which will be urged upon Parliament,
the most clearly and indisputably
right and necessary, and, added to
the plan already suggested for pursuing
individual cases of venality,
will probably sweep away the most
incurably corrupt class of electors.”—<cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite>, Oct. 1853, p. 596.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have already seen that, in
Oct. 1852, the reviewer proposed to
abstract thirty members from the
smaller English boroughs. It became
evident, however, that so paltry a
massacre of the innocents would not
suffice, more especially as it had become
part of the scheme to swamp
the English counties. Accordingly
we are told, in an off-hand and easy
manner: “To all that we said on a
former occasion as to the theoretical
propriety and justice of the <em>small</em>
borough representation, we unreservedly
adhere. But, unfortunately, it
is too notorious that these boroughs
are generally in a condition which,
for the sake of electoral purity,
imperatively demands their disfranchisement,
partial or entire. <em>Here
again it is true that parliamentary
statistics do not altogether bear out our
conclusion.</em> Of the seventy-two
boroughs convicted of bribery between
1833 and 1853, only twenty-one
can properly be called small—as
having fewer than five hundred
electors—while some of the more
constantly and flagrantly impure
places number their votes by thousands.”
So, according to the admission
of even this writer, there is no
case established, on the ground of
corruption, for the wholesale disfranchisement
of the small boroughs.
Nevertheless we are to assume them
to be impure, because he says it is
notorious that they are so; and by
this short and summary process of
assertion he gets rid of the trouble of
investigation. The boroughs are not
put upon their trial, for there is no
specific charge against them; but
they are condemned at once because
the writer has a low opinion of their
morality. This is worse than Jeddart
justice, where the trial took place
after the execution. In the case of
the boroughs there is to be no trial
at all. The following conclusion is
therefore easily arrived at: “There
can be no doubt in the mind of any
reformer that, in some way or other,
these small boroughs ought to be
suppressed; that we must have, if
possible, no more constituencies under
one thousand electors.” So much for
the disfranchisement; now for the redistribution.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Final scheme suggested to Lord John
Russell for disfranchising the small
boroughs and swamping the counties.</em>—“The
third method proposed is to
merge all these small boroughs into
the county constituencies, by depriving
them of their members, and reducing
the county franchise to a £10
occupancy. In this way the class
would still be represented, and the
individuals would still retain their
votes, and the electoral lists of counties
would be considerably modified
and greatly enriched. This plan
would, we think, be far the fairest
and most desirable, inasmuch as it
would give us constituencies large in
number and varied in character, and,
therefore, to a great extent secure
against illicit and undue influences.”—<cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite>, Oct. 1853, p. 602.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next and last point which we
shall notice is the representation of
minorities. We do not know to
whom the credit of having invented
this notable scheme is really due.
There are various claimants in the
field. Mr G. L. Craik, of Queen’s
College, Belfast, asserts that he was
the original discoverer, having propounded
a plan of this nature so early
as 1836. Ingenious as the idea may
be, it will hardly rank in importance
with the discovery of the steam-engine,
nor do we think that its
originator is entitled to any exorbitant
share of public gratitude or
applause. We shall give it as we
find it in the <cite>Review</cite>.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Source of Lord John Russell’s proposal
to give members in certain cases
to minorities.</em>—“The mode by which
we propose to insure the constituent
minorities their fair share in the representation—<em>i.
e.</em> to make the majorities
and minorities in the House of
Commons correspond as nearly as
may be to majorities and minorities
in the country, or in the electoral
bodies—is, to give (as now) to each
elector as many votes as there are
members to be chosen, and to allow
him to divide these votes as he pleases
among the candidates, <em>or to give them
all to one</em>. But as at present most
places return two members, it is obvious
that, under the proposed arrangement,
wherever the minority
<em>exceeded one-third</em> of the total number
of the electors, they would be able to
return one member, or to obtain <em>one-half</em>
the representation, which would
be more than their fair share, and
would place them on an equality with
the majority, which would never do;
while, if they <em>fell short of one-third</em>,
they would be, as now, virtually
unrepresented and ignored. To obviate
this, it will be necessary so to
arrange our electoral divisions, that
as many constituencies as possible
should return <em>three</em> members: one of
these a minority, if at all respectable,
could always manage to secure.”—<cite>Edin.
Review</cite>, Oct. 1853, p. 622.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here, at all events, is the notion
about the representation of majorities,
and the establishment of as many
constituencies as possible, returning
<em>three</em> members. Lord John Russell’s
method of working this, is to restrict
each elector to two votes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus we see that all the leading
features and peculiarities of Lord
John Russell’s new Reform Bill—the
disfranchisement of the boroughs, the
swamping of the counties, the ten-pound
occupancy clause, the qualification
by deposit in the savings’ bank,
the voting of graduates, the retention
of their seats by members accepting
office, and the representation of minorities—are
contained in the articles
published in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, in
1852 and 1853. This is, to say the
least of it, a very singular coincidence.
Of course we do not mean to maintain
that Lord John Russell was debarred
from availing himself of any
useful hints which might be offered
him, or from adopting the notions of
any political sage, or harum-scarum
cobbler of constitutions; we entirely
admit his right to gather wisdom, or
its counterfeit, from any source whatever.
What we wish to impress upon
the public is this, that, down to 1852,
not one of these notions had occurred
to our grand constitutional reformer,
who for twenty years had been sedulously
watching the operation of
his original measure! Nay, more than
that: two years ago, his ideas on the
subject of Parliamentary Reform were
diametrically opposite to those which
he has now promulgated; and that not
only in detail, but in absolute essence
and form! Had he come before us
this year with a scheme based upon
the principle of 1852, which was
a lowering of the franchise, without
any farther disturbance of the constitution
of the electoral bodies, it would
have been but a poor criticism to have
taunted him with a minor change
in the details. He might have used
his discretion in elevating or lowering
the point where the franchise was to
begin, without subjecting himself to
any sneer on account of change of
principle. But, wonderful as are the
changes which we have seen of late
years in the views of public men, this
is the most astounding of them all.
Never before, perhaps, did a statesman
pass such a decided censure on
his own judgment, or make such an
admission of former recklessness and
error. If he is right now, he must
have been utterly wrong before. The
constitution of 1852, as he would have
made it, must have been a bad one.
One-tenth of the members of the
House of Commons would still have
been returned by constituencies which
he now regards as unfit to be constituencies
any more. If the maintenance
of the small boroughs is a
blot on the constitution, how was it
that Lord John Russell did not discover
that blot until 1853, after the
articles we have referred to were
published? Did he take his ideas
from those articles? If so, was there
ever a more humiliating confession of
entire poverty of mind? If he did
not take his ideas from those articles,
what was it that produced so entire a
change of opinion?—what eminent
political oculist has removed the film
which impeded his vision but two
short years ago? This is, in reality,
a very grave matter. We are accustomed
in this country to associate
measures with men, and sometimes
to accept the former on account of
our belief and confidence in the
sagacity of those who propose them.
But what faith can we repose in a
man who thus plays fast and loose
upon a question with which he has
been occupied all his life? This is
not a case of expediency arising out
of unforeseen circumstances. That
the question is of the deepest import
no one in his senses can deny. We
know how the constitution, as framed
at present, works; but we do not
know how it may work if very materially
altered. And yet we find the
same mechanist proposing, within two
years, two separate kinds of alteration!
The first was simple enough, and had
at least this much in its favour, that
it did not require any violent displacement
of the machinery. The second
is so complex that the whole machinery
must be re-arranged. It was our
sincere hope that the country had
seen the last of sudden conversions of
parties—at no time edifying events,
and sometimes attended by disastrous
consequences—but we must, it seems,
prepare ourselves for another conversion
on the part of the Whigs, if
this bill is to be carried through.
They must, supposing them inclined
to support Lord John Russell, either
unsay what they said, or were prepared
to have said, in 1852, or be
ready to maintain that they were
then greatly in advance of their
leader. The dilemma, we admit, is
an unpleasant and an odious one;
but there is no escape from it, if the
Whigs are determined, at all hazards,
to follow their erratic leader.</p>

<p class='c009'>That there is room for certain
changes in the national representation
we are by no means disposed to
deny. It is impossible to devise any
system so perfect as to preclude the
idea of amendment; indeed, we suppose
that there never was a constitution,
or phase of a constitution, in the
world, which gave entire and perfect
satisfaction to all who lived under its
operation. We may be told that the
present system is theoretically wrong,
that its principle is to exalt property
and to exclude intelligence, and that
in some parts it is incongruous, inconsistent,
and contradictory. Possibly
there may be some truth in such
allegations; but then we must never
lose sight of this, that the real test of
a constitution is its practical working.
It is undeniable that under the present
system the middle classes have gained,
not only power, but preponderance in
the state; and accordingly we find
that they are not favourable to a
change which would certainly operate
to their disadvantage. The ulterior
aims of the men of Manchester may
prompt them to desire a still further
infusion of the democratic element,
but neither the members nor the doctrines
of that school have found
favour with the British public. If
public opinion generally, and the
great interests of the nation, are well
and effectively represented in the
House of Commons, it does seem to
us a very perilous experiment to
disturb that state of matters. We
should like very much to hear from
Lord John Russell a distinct exposition
of the results which he anticipates,
should this scheme of his be
carried. Is there any real point of
interest to the nation which he is at
present debarred from bringing forward
by the exclusive constitution of
the House of Commons? What are
the existing grievances which call for
so radical an alteration?</p>

      <div class='line'>That Cæsar and his senate must redress?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We apprehend that the noble lord
would be greatly puzzled to frame
an intelligible answer to such queries.
Well then, we are, perforce, compelled
to fall back upon theory, and to assume
that he vindicates his proposal,
not because future measures will be of
a better kind, or better discussed than
heretofore, but because it is desirable,
for symmetry’s sake, that the representation
should be readjusted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Be it so. We are content to take
that view, albeit a low one, and to
examine his scheme without any partial
leaning to the present constitution
of the House of Commons. And
first, let us see what regard he has
paid to the principle of equal representation.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will not, we presume, be denied
by any one that the three kingdoms
of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
ought to be put upon an equitable
footing as regards one another in this
matter of representation. If imperial
measures were all that the House of
Commons had to discuss, this relative
equality might be of less importance;
but with separate laws and separate
institutions guaranteed to and existing
in the three kingdoms, it is proper
that each should be fairly represented
in the grand council of the nation.
At present that is not the case. If
we take the test of population, Scotland
ought to have 18 more members
than are now allotted to her; if we
take the test of taxation and revenue,
she ought to have 25 more. Combining
the two, there is a deficit of more
than 20 members to Scotland in her
share of the national representation.
Now, that is a matter which ought,
in the very first instance, to have occupied
the attention of the noble lord,
and would have so occupied it, had
he laid down for himself any fixed
principles of action. It is nonsense
to talk of inequalities between one
borough and another, or between
town and country qualification, before
the first grand inequality is remedied.
Apply the double test of population
and revenue, and you will find that
Ireland is upon an equality in point
of representation with England, but
that Scotland is not; and no reason
has been, or can be, assigned for this
anomaly. The quota for Scotland
was fixed by the Act of Union at 45
members. It was increased by the
Reform Act of 1832 to 53, but the
number is still insufficient. Lord
John Russell proposes, out of the 66
disfranchised seats, to give <em>three</em> to
Scotland, but he has assigned no
reason for doing so. The people of
Scotland are not in the position of
men supplicating for a boon. They
are demanding that, when such a
change as this is made, their political
rights shall be respected and allowed;
and they will not be satisfied with
less than a measure of perfect justice.
We think it right to put forward this
point prominently, because it lies at the
foundation of the whole question of the
readjustment of the representation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The question of the disfranchisement
of the boroughs is one which
should be approached with very great
caution. In 1852, as we have already
seen, Lord John Russell did not propose
to touch them—now he has made
up his mind to lop away 66 members
from this branch of the representation.
This is, in our opinion, by
far too reckless a proceeding. We
can see no good ground or principle
for the entire disfranchisement
of any of the boroughs, a step which
we think ought never to be taken,
except in case of absolute and proved
corruption. When constituencies are
too small, the proper and natural
plan is, to annex and unite, not to
abolish; and we believe that this could
be effected with very little difficulty.
The new Schedule A contains a list of
19 boroughs, returning at present 29
members, which are to be wholly disfranchised,
on the ground either that
the number of the electors is under
300, or that of the inhabitants under
5000. Therefore the privilege is to
be taken from them, and the voters
are to be thrown into the counties.
We agree with Lord John Russell,
that some constituencies are too small,
but we do not agree with him in his
scheme of disfranchisement, and we
utterly object to his proposal of quartering
the electors on the counties.
They are borough voters, and so they
ought to remain; and it is a very
poor pretext, indeed, to make this disfranchisement
the excuse for altering
the county qualification. Let a union
of the boroughs, by all means, take
place; let the number of their members,
if necessary, be considerably reduced;
but let us have no disfranchisement,
or assimilation between the
town and county qualification, which
would quite upset the whole system
throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c009'>We do not profess to be conversant
with local details, so that we cannot
speak with perfect confidence; but it
appears to us that some such arrangement
as the following, which would
unite the smaller boroughs, and at
the same time diminish the number
of members, might be adopted with
advantage:—</p>

<p class='c016'>Here there are twenty-three seats
set at liberty, without disfranchisement
in any one instance. In justice
to ourselves, we must state that we
have implicitly followed the schedule
attached to Lord John Russell’s bill,
and not indulged in speculations of
our own. Had the latter been the
case, we might have been tempted to
ask why Westbury, with an electorate
of 289, is to be spared, while Wells,
with 368, is to be blotted from the
list of boroughs?</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides these, Lord John Russell
proposes that thirty other seats shall
be made vacant, by restricting
boroughs now returning two members
to one. (His number is thirty-three,
but we have already noticed Ripon,
Tewkesbury, and Guildford.) If it
could be shown that there is a really
clamant case for representation elsewhere,
the reduction might be allowed,
but only to the extent required.
It seems to us perfect madness to proceed
with wholesale disfranchisement,
until the necessity of transferring
seats to other places is satisfactorily
established. We can very well understand
why some of the smaller
boroughs which have now two members
should be restricted to one, in
order to satisfy the just requirements
of some rising township which has
hitherto been unrepresented. We
have no doubt that Lord John Russell
is quite right in his proposals to
give members to Birkenhead, Burnley,
and Staleybridge, and to erect Chelsea
and Kensington into a Parliamentary
borough to return two members.
We think that two additional members
each might be granted to the
West Riding of Yorkshire and to the
county of Lancaster—that Salford
should return two members instead of
one—and that the London University
should be represented. We think
that these are rational demands, and
such as might be accorded; and the
necessary number for these purposes,
and for putting Scotland on a fair
footing of equality with England and
Ireland, would amount to the vacation
of about thirty or thirty-two
existing seats. We have already
shown how, without entirely disfranchising
any borough, twenty-three
seats may be obtained; and if nine
others are required, it would be no
hardship to take from each of the following
boroughs one out of the two
members which they presently return:—</p>

<p class='c016'>This would take out of Schedule B
no less than twenty-one seats which
are now included in it; and it would
be obviously unwise to exhaust, all
at once, the only source from which
new rising constituencies can be endowed.
Lord John Russell seems to
think—and we agree with him—that
the present number of the House of
Commons (654) is quite large enough;
and although there is no principle to
fix numbers, it may be as well to
maintain them as they are. It is but
natural to expect that, in future years,
some places will decrease, and others
increase, and that partial changes
will be required. For that very
reason we deprecate too hasty a reduction
of the boroughs, and an apportionment
of their seats to places
and constituencies which do not require
them. Suppose that in ten
years after this, new seats of commerce
and manufacture, like Birkenhead,
Burnley, and Staleybridge,
start into existence—that places like
Salford increase immensely—and that
new Chelseas require to be conjoined
with new Kensingtons—where are we
to find members for them, without
unduly swelling the bulk of the
House of Commons, if all the smaller
borough seats are to be disposed of
at the present time? The Legislature
may say just now, with perfect propriety,
to the men of Lymington—“Your
borough is the smallest in the
country which returns two members
to Parliament. Birkenhead is a place
of such importance that it requires a
member; and therefore, as it is not
expedient to increase the aggregate
number of the national representatives,
we shall take a member from you,
and give one to Birkenhead.” That
is quite intelligible; but why disfranchise
boroughs when you do not know
what to do with the vacancies? It
is true that Lord John Russell tells
us what he means to do with them;
but we entirely demur to every proposal
of his beyond those which we
have already noticed. He proposes,
we observe, to give three members
instead of two to the following cities
and boroughs whose constituencies
we have noted:—</p>

<p class='c016'>It must strike every one that there
can be no principle in this. The constituencies
both of Manchester and
Liverpool are more than five times
larger than that of Bradford, and yet
all of them are to have three members;
whereas the Tower Hamlets
with 25,366, Marylebone with 20,377,
and Lambeth with 18,522 electors,
are but to have two each as heretofore.
Even the sage of the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite> has borne testimony to the
impropriety and injustice of adding to
the number of representatives returned
for large towns. In his article of
October 1852, he says:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would appear that the large towns
have their full share of the representation;
since, if we add the small boroughs
to the counties, on the supposition of
their returning a somewhat similar class
of members, and containing a somewhat
similar constituency, the comparison would
stand thus:—</p>

<table class='table1'>

    <td class='c004'>206</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c024'>—whereas the proper arithmetical proportion
for the cities would be 169, instead
of 206.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fact is, that Lord John Russell
has assigned an additional number to
each of these towns, not because they
require one, but in order to make the
extraordinary experiment, to which
we have already alluded, of the representation
of minorities in Parliament.
For that reason, also, he proposes to
give thirty-six additional members to
so many counties and their divisions,
making each up to the number of
three, so that minorities may be represented
on rather an extensive
scale. We shall have occasion presently
to say a word or two on that
subject. The notion seems to us not
only impracticable, but positively silly;
and such as no man of ordinary sense
could entertain for a moment. Even
were it more feasible than it appears,
that would not justify an unnecessary
disfranchisement of the boroughs. We
can see no reason for parting with
them so abruptly—many for retaining
them; because, undoubtedly, they
keep the balance even between town
and country, and so perform a very
valuable function in the Legislature.
We do not dispute the propriety of
their remodelment or curtailment.
Our views, in that respect, are, we
submit, sufficiently liberal; for we
think it just that from them, as small
constituencies, any palpable defect or
positive need in the national representation
should be supplied. But we
will not consent to their sacrifice
merely for theoretical experiment; or
in order to give colour to the proposal
for assimilating the town and county
franchise—in other words, for swamping
the latter representation. We
are greatly surprised that Lord John
Russell should, in his mature years,
have thus been led astray. In the
popular ferment of 1831–2—the particulars
of which are better known to
his lordship than to us—almost any
proposal might have gone down; but
now reason instead of passion must
be appealed to and satisfied, before
any one can be allowed to make a
material inroad on the Constitution.
Lord John is singularly unfortunate.
Mr Bright is quite as much opposed
to the notion of the representation of
minorities as we are; and we venture
to say that the collective voice of the
counties, to which he proposes to give
an additional member, will be raised
against him. We need not press the
point that the borough electors will
be especially unwilling to lose their
existing privileges. And if it should
so happen—as we know, and as every
man who knows the political feeling
of the country, must be the case—that
both the disfranchised parties, and
those whose franchise is thereby nominally
increased, hold the scheme in
detestation and contempt, how is it
possible that he can hope to carry it
even through the House of Commons?
He has no enthusiasm to back him.
He is not attempting to give voice to
the opinion of any large section of the
public—he is simply repeating, parrot-like
and without examination, in
opposition to all he has heretofore
said, the opinions enunciated by another.
He is theorising, contrary to
his own experience; and sacrificing,
for a mere crotchet, his own arrangements,
which, for twenty years, and
until 1852, he deemed to be mathematically
correct.</p>

<p class='c009'>We now come to the question of
qualification. This is a very serious
one, and cannot be properly treated
without reference to our existing
fiscal arrangements. Indirect taxation
has been reduced to the lowest
possible limit; and, in order to make
up the deficiency in the revenue occasioned
by numerous relaxations, we
are forced to submit to an income-tax
which amounted last year to more
than five and a half millions, levied
from those persons only who are in
receipt of more than £100 yearly.
From Mr Gladstone’s financial statement,
it appears that the Government
does not intend to increase the amount
of the national debt by contracting
fresh loans, but that the inevitable
expenses of the war, however large,
are to be defrayed by additional
yearly taxation. Further, we are
told that it is not proposed to raise
any portion of this by again resorting
to indirect taxation, but that the
whole of it is to be charged upon those
persons who are already rated to the
income-tax. We subscribe in theory
to the opinion, that it is not advisable
for the interests of posterity to increase
the amount of the national debt;
which might, however, have been
cleared off during the years of peace
but for the insane system pursued by
successive Ministries, of abandoning
indirect taxation for the sake of immediate
popularity. In practice, it
may be found impossible to avoid the
contraction of fresh loans. It is not
likely, for some time at least, that any
Ministry will be bold enough to resort
to the customs and excise duties for
the supply of the yearly deficiency,
so that there really seems no other
available course than that of taxing
property and income still farther.
The effect of this is, that a certain limited
class is made to pay for the
others, and that the great bulk of the
population are exempted. How long
this can be endured we shall not venture
to predict. We have demonstrated
over and over again, in the
pages of the Magazine, the extreme
impolicy and ultimate danger of continuing
a war tax in time of peace,
and the result shows the soundness
of our warning. The day will arrive
when this burden will become so
great as to be intolerable; and then,
perhaps, it may be discovered that,
in abandoning easy and evident sources
of revenue, our commercial legislators
have committed a most grievous error.
At present, however, we can only
look to the fiscal arrangements which
have been proposed. It is obvious,
at least to us, that it would be highly
inexpedient, and even dangerous, to
lodge political power in the hands of
those who are not called upon to contribute
directly to the necessities of
the State. If you are to select a certain
class as peculiar rate-payers, and
to compel them, year after year, to
make up the deficiency of the national
income, whatever that may be, you
are bound also to give them peculiar
privileges. We care not how low you
make the assessment. Indeed, we
are of opinion that it should be brought
down to the lowest possible limit,
which, probably, would be fixed, as
regards income, at £60 per annum.
But whatever that limit may be, this
principle ought to be established, that
no man, not rated to the property
and income tax, shall hereafter be
capable of voting, or of being enrolled.
This is the only good security we can
have against confiscation. It is said
that the idea of a war is peculiarly
popular in the country. No wonder
that it should be so. The artisan is
informed that no additional tax will
be laid in consequence upon any article
of his consumpt; that the price
of his beer, spirits, tea, coffee, sugar,
and tobacco, will not be raised; and
that others will defray the cost of
equipping those fine fleets, and maintaining
those splendid troops, which
he cheers as they leave our shores.
Very different are the feelings of the
unfortunate individual who, by dint of
industry, has worked his way to an
income of £150 a-year, and has a
wife and family to support. Last
year he had to pay £4, 7s. 6d., directly
to the Exchequer, and was consoling
himself with the vision that,
after April 1855, his contribution
would be lowered to £3, 15s. Down
upon him, like a vulture, swoops the
tax-gatherer, with a demand for
£7, 11s. 3d., to be increased if the
war goes on. You cannot expect that
man to be quite as enthusiastic as the
artisan, whose voice, like that of
Sempronius, is still for war, so long
as he escapes untaxed. It is easy to
be patriotic when there is nothing
whatever to pay. What we advocate,
therefore, is, an extension of the property
and income tax to the lowest
available limit, and an exclusion from
the franchise of all those who do not
contribute to it. It is a proposition
not only fair and reasonable, but imperatively
necessary under the circumstances
in which we are placed;
and no one can complain of injustice
in being excluded from a privilege for
which he does not pay, either from
want of means, or because he fraudulently
evades the tax.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, this is tantamount to a
rejection of Lord John Russell’s proposal,
that persons having £50 for a
certain period of time deposited in a
savings’ bank, shall be entitled to the
franchise. This is a proposal which
really will not bear examination. In
the first place, it would lead to a prodigious
deal of fictitious registration
and wholesale manufacture of votes;
in the second place, it is a most invidious
and senseless preference given
to one species of property beyond another.
Why a savings’ bank? Are
chartered, joint-stock, or private
banks not as good? And why give
a vote for £50 in the shape of a deposit
only? Money is only equivalent
to money’s worth. The man
who expends £50 in the furnishing of
his house, or in purchasing a share in
some small business, or in fifty other
ways of investment, is as good or
better than his neighbour, who lets
his money lie in the savings’ bank. It
is utterly absurd to select one only
kind of deposit for the franchise, practically
excluding hundreds of thousands,
who have more money invested
in a different way. Then, again, what
means are to be devised for ascertaining
the right of parties so registered
to continue on the roll? The tenure
is obviously of the most precarious
kind. An election takes place to-day,
and a depositor votes in virtue of his
£50; to-morrow he withdraws it from
the bank. How is that to be ascertained?
We presume it is not contemplated
that the savings’-bank
books shall be open to the inspection
of the public; and if not, where are
the means of ascertaining the continued
qualification of parties? In
like manner, we object to the qualification
of £10 of yearly dividend from
the Funds, or from bank stock. It is
reasonable enough, perhaps, on account
of their educational attainments,
that graduates of universities should
be admitted to vote either in town or
county, <em>provided that they are assessed
to the property and income tax, but not
otherwise</em>; and the receipt of £100
a-year of salary, as it implies direct
rating, may be taken as a sufficient
qualification for borough or town
voting.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we are not at all prepared to
agree to the proposed assimilation of
the town and county franchise. It is
a direct and dangerous innovation on
the principle of the British constitution,
which is, that the county representation
shall be kept apart from
that of the towns and boroughs. The
Act of 1832 admitted the proprietor
of a £10 house, not situated
within the boundaries of a borough,
to a county vote; and the result
of that, in some localities, has been,
that the voters in villages and
small towns which were not boroughs,
have been numerous enough to
swamp and overpower the proper
county constituency. That was bad
enough; but it is now proposed that
<em>occupiers</em> shall have the franchise;
and, as we remarked last month, it is
not by any means necessary that the
house which the voter occupies should
be of the yearly value of £10. We
must again quote the words of Lord
John Russell: “We propose, with
respect to the county right of voting,
that—with the exception of a dwelling-house,
<em>which may be of any value,
provided the voter lives in it</em>—in all
other cases the building must be of
the value of £5 a-year. Supposing
there is a house and land, the house
may be rated at £1 or £2 a-year,
provided the voter resides in it; but if
the qualification is made out by any
other building—a cattle-shed, or any
other building of that kind—then we
propose this check, that such building
shall be of the value of £5 a-year.
This, then, is the franchise we propose
to give in counties for the future.”
Thus the English counties are to be
inundated, 1st, By £10 occupiers, not
resident within borough boundaries;
and, 2dly, By the voters of sixty-six
disfranchised boroughs, who are to be
thrown loose upon them! We are
confident that, in any case, such a
proposal as this will be rejected. The
counties do not want additional members
at the expense of the boroughs;
and we think it is, on principle, most
important that the two kinds of representation
should be preserved distinct.
Indeed, but for the crotchet of giving
representation to minorities, by assigning
to as many constituencies as
possible three members each, we
should probably have heard nothing
of this transfer of borough representation.
That the county franchise
may be advantageously lowered as
regards tenants, we are ready to admit.
Let them be enrolled from £20
upwards, provided they pay property
and income tax, which, according to
our view, ought to be made an indispensable
condition to the franchise.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we shall be asked, what is to
become of £10 occupants residing beyond
borough boundaries, who are
really rated to the income-tax? Are
they to remain unrepresented? Our
reply is, that they ought to be represented,
and can be represented, without
sending them to the county-roll.
The true, sound, and equitable method
is to enlarge the parliamentary
boundaries of boroughs, so that persons
of this class may be enrolled in
the nearest borough to their residence.
Such enlargement may be made irrespective
of other persons who are
entitled to the county franchise, and
who would still claim to be placed
upon that roll. In this way, no one
really entitled to vote would be excluded:
both counties and boroughs
would be preserved; and the latter
would receive a very considerable
augmentation of numbers from a class
of men who at present do not enjoy
the franchise.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is but one point more to which
we shall specially refer, and that is
the proposed representation of minorities.
We have shown, in a former
article, that this is perfectly unworkable,
and moreover greatly to be deprecated,
as entirely changing the
relations of the electors and their
representatives. It can only, according
to Lord John Russell’s admission,
be attempted in constituencies which
are to be allowed three representatives;
and the simple fact of its being
the exception, and not the rule, seems
to us sufficient to condemn it. We
have already put the case of the death
or resignation of one of these minority
members, and we cannot see how his
place can be supplied, unless it is
enacted that the candidate lowest on
the poll is to be returned. It is
neither sensible nor equitable to challenge
the authority of majorities. If
you leave a question, whether it relate
to men or measures, to be decided
by a certain number of people, you
must perforce adopt and acquiesce in
the verdict of the majority. But it is
within our power to render the majorities
less oppressive, by multiplying
as much as possible the number of the
tribunals of appeal.</p>

<p class='c009'>This brings us to the consideration
of a topic which we broached in the
last number of the Magazine, and
which, we venture to say, is well
worthy of the attention of our statesmen.
It cannot be denied that in
many places, especially large towns,
there is an immense degree of apathy
on the part of those who are entitled
to the franchise. Men who are in the
possession or occupation of property
far more than sufficient to entitle them
to vote, do not even take the pains to
place themselves on the roll; and
many of those who are on the roll
will not give themselves the trouble
to vote. It is remarkable also that
these are generally men of wealth,
station, and intelligence—belonging,
in short, to the class most likely to
use the franchise with discretion and
independence. The reason of this
apparent apathy is, that they know
quite well that they will be outvoted.
In urban constituencies of four thousand
or upwards, returning two members
each, every one knows beforehand
how the election will go, and
consequently no effort is made by a
desponding minority. We grant that
such ought not to be the case; because
an elector, though he may not
be able to find a candidate of his own
way of thinking, can always exercise
a wholesome control, by voting for
the man who, in his judgment, is the
best in the field—but there can be no
doubt that the case is as we represent
it. For example, at last election,
there voted, in round numbers, at
London, only 7,500 out of 20,000
electors—at Finsbury, 9,000 out of
20,000—at Lambeth, 8,000 out of
18,000—at Manchester, 9,000 out of
13,000—at Westminster, 800 out of
14,800—at Sheffield, 3,500 out of
5,300—at York, 2,500 out of 4,100—at
Edinburgh, 3,500 out of 6,900—at
Glasgow, 5,000 out of 16,500.
These represent the actual numbers
on the register, but not the number of
those entitled to be enrolled, but who
have not lodged claims. In short, the
activity in voting and enrolling seems
to decline in proportion to the size of
the constituency.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is but one way of remedying
this, and that is by recurring to the
simple principle <em>that no man shall be
entitled, in one place, to vote for more
than a single member</em>. We do not
mean by this that large populations
should be restricted to a single member—that
would be unfair, and even
preposterous. We mean that each
county, division of a county, city,
town, or borough, which has more
than one member allotted to it, should
be subdivided into parishes, districts,
or wards, each to return a member,
according to the votes of the majority
of the qualified electors within
it. Thus London would be divided
into four electoral districts; Liverpool,
Manchester, Edinburgh, and
others into two; and the counties
would, in the same way, be partitioned
into so many districts as there were
members to be returned. This system
is at present in partial operation in the
counties of England, which are split
into divisions, and there undoubtedly
the system has worked well and satisfactorily.
No man in his senses
would propose that each county elector
of Yorkshire should have six votes;
and we really cannot see why one
man, because he happens to live in a
large town, should have double the
personal political influence of another
who resides in a small borough. It
does not necessarily follow, by any
means, that the members to be returned
under the operation of the system
which we propose should be antagonistic
to one another. It would,
we are convinced, materially tend to
improve the representation, by infusing
fresh energy into the constituencies;
it is already recognised,
and partially in effect; and it is not
liable to any of the objections which
it requires no ingenuity to rear against
Lord John Russell’s absurd scheme
for giving members to minorities.</p>

<p class='c009'>We might say a great deal more on
the subject of the present bill, but
we think that further comment is
needless. We have shown, by absolute
demonstration, that it is not
the result of Lord John Russell’s own
Parliamentary experience—that, for
twenty years of his public life, dating
from 1832, he had failed to see the
proper method of amending the representation
of the people—and that he
was at last enlightened by a series of
articles, which display as little consistency
as wisdom. We have shown
also that he has not probed the great
question of the relative proportional
representation of the three united
kingdoms—that he proposes to demolish
borough representation, without
any necessity for doing so—and
that he wishes entirely to change, or
rather to abrogate, the ancient distinction
between town and county
franchise. We have shown that he
has not taken at all into consideration
the recent fiscal changes, and that he
proposes to place those who are
heavily and directly taxed on the
same footing with those who are allowed
to escape that burden. We
have shown that other parts of his
scheme are either merely fantastical,
or dictated by party motives; and
having said so much, we are content
to abide by the decision of the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>If this bill is again brought forward
on the 27th of April, or a later day
in the session, we do not believe that
it will ever pass into the statute-book.
If it is withdrawn, on the
score of inconvenience or otherwise,
we are perfectly certain that it will
not again appear in its present shape;
for, many as are the legislative proposals
which we have had occasion
to consider, this is, beyond comparison,
the worst digested, most incoherent
and most rambling measure of
them all.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>
  <h2 class='c002'>THE BLUE BOOKS AND THE EASTERN QUESTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding the imposing
aspect of these azure tomes, technically
termed <cite>Blue Books</cite>, we confess
we do not look upon them without a
feeling of suspicion or incredulity.
No doubt the usages of Parliament
and the will of the Crown require
the production of documents relating
to every important transaction connected
with our foreign policy, and
they are intended to furnish ample
and accurate details of our international
acts, and to unfold to the
public the intricacies of complicated
and tedious negotiations. Such is
the object of those expensive publications;
but, for the attainment of that
object, they should be not merely
authentic, but complete. And when
we say that we do not regard the
<cite>Blue Books</cite> with all the respect that
full confidence inspires, it is because
we know that the papers they contain
are well sifted and culled: those
parts which would prove the weakness,
the ignorance, and the imprudence
of a Minister, are so carefully
kept out of sight, and so curtailed,
and those in his favour so prominently
brought forward, that we have, after
all, a very partial, and consequently
a very imperfect, view of the manner
in which a negotiation has been conducted.
Truth, they say, lies at the
bottom of a well: the Foreign Office
may be that well, but the eye of the
public is not always enabled to pierce
its depth. Moreover, we have heard
it related that some Ministers indulge
a vicious habit of communicating
instructions to their diplomatic agents
in notes or letters marked <em>private</em>, or
evidently meant to be so from their
familiar style and tone; and that
some letters contain hints or instructions
sometimes contrary to the official
despatches. This is unjust to
the public, and unfair to the diplomatic
agent himself, who, in case his
conduct should become subject of inquiry
or censure in Parliament, is
thus debarred from defending himself,
because the real instructions on which
he acted bear the stamp of privacy,
which delicacy forbids him to violate;
and it is quite certain that the <cite>Blue
Books</cite> contain no trace of those confidential
missives. There is one
personage in particular whose name
has been more connected than any
other with our foreign policy, who is
said to carry this habit to such a
point as to force complaints from his
own subordinates.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are not exempt from human
weakness: we confess that we have
more than once cast a curious and a
longing glance on those plethoric
Jacks which daily issue from Downing
Street, and the safe conveyance
of which to their distant destination
costs the country annually a handsome
sum of money. We have often
desired to dive to the very bottom of
these round white leathern envelopes,
which are so tenderly handled and so
scrupulously guarded. What profound
thoughts, what foresight, what
eloquence, and what wisdom, must
be contained, we have often thought,
within that mysterious covering of
calf, of more than aldermanic rotundity,
tightly closed at the neck with
whipcord, and the genius of England
protecting the orifice in the form and
fashion of a huge red seal. It is true
that idle or blabbing clerks, and
supercilious or rollicking messengers—the
external “gentlemen” of the
Foreign Office—are said to indulge occasionally
in a laugh, whilst lounging
in their waiting-room, at the reverential
awe with which the vulgar
are wont to look upon the “despatch
bags.” Strange stories, too, are said
to be current of the miscellanies
which sometimes fill them, the curious
<i><span lang="ca">olla podrida</span></i>, the several parts of
which are so well adapted to the
tastes of the youthful <i><span lang="fr">employés</span></i> of our
foreign embassies. Packages of pomatum,
bottles of hair-dye, pots of
varnish, patent-leather boots, and
dress-coats, are occasionally conveyed
to the capital where we are blessed
with a representative who unites in
his own person the conflicting tastes
of dandyism and parsimony. Gossipping
tongues speak of even more
important cargoes—not, of course,
in the bag, but outside it—that were
sometimes conveyed, at her Majesty’s
expense, to her “Honourable” or
“Right Honourable” representative,
under the care of some bustling
“gentleman,” whose official character
is indicated by the Windsor uniform,
and a minute badge with the royal
arms, and the effigy (a harmless
irony) of a greyhound—the latter
symbolical of the speed at which he
is presumed to travel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Taking the present <cite>Blue Books</cite> at
the value set upon them by the Government,
we believe that every impartial
man who has glanced over
their contents, and who has read the
debates in Parliament, will be convinced
of the blindness, the weakness—we
will not say the criminality—of
the Cabinet, in all that relates to the
Eastern question. It is in vain that
we attempt to defend their conduct
on the ground of <em>ignorance</em>, for there
are abundant proofs in the documents
before us, however imperfect they
may be, that they were not ignorant,
and were not unwarned of what was
going on. The evidence is too clear
even for audacity to deny, or hypocrisy
to diminish. They themselves
have been forced to admit that they
were outwitted and duped as no men
were ever duped before; and however
a generous and forgiving people
may pardon the fault for the frankness
of the confession, such imbecility
in the past is but poor encouragement
for the future. The noble lord who
holds the post of Prime Minister is
indeed unfortunate in his general
estimate of men and things. When
the Revolution of February was on
the point of bursting forth, he is
said to have declared his conviction
that King Louis Philippe and his
dynasty were firmer than ever on the
throne of France. After a long, and,
we presume, conscientious study of
the President of the new French republic,
the same acute intellect pronounced
Louis Napoleon to be little
better than an idiot, and in contemptuous
terms described him as
incapable in thought and action.
When the votes of millions approved
and confirmed the daring illegality of
the act of December 1851, he believed
that his rule could not last three
months: and in the latest exercise of
his discrimination and knowledge of
the world, our great statesman laughed
to scorn the fear that the Emperor
Nicholas ever contemplated any attack
against the integrity of the Ottoman
Empire, and this at the moment when
every post was bringing home news
of the hostile attitude of Russia; when
the newspapers teemed with accounts
of the movements of armies in the
south of Russia; when that force was
placed on a war footing, and provisioned
as if on the eve of a campaign;
when a fleet was at Sebastopol
ready to weigh anchor; when
wood was cut down for the construction
of pontoons and bridges for the
Pruth and Danube; and when Constantinople
itself was menaced with a
<i><span lang="fr">coup de main</span></i>;<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a> when the magazines
of Odessa were gorged with military
stores for the complete equipment of
150,000 men; when troops had already
marched to the Turkish frontier;
when Prince Menschikoff was
outraging the Sultan in his own capital,
and dictating who should, or who
should not, be his minister. And with
the reports of our own diplomatic and
consular agents confirming all those
facts, the noble Lord at the head of
her Majesty’s Government was smiling
complacently at the compliments
lavished on him by that great master
of irony, Count Nesselrode, who
chuckled with his imperial master at
the simplicity of the statesman refusing
to believe the evidence of his
senses. We have seldom witnessed
so much prevarication, so much barefaced
misstatement, as have been exhibited
on this question. It was denied
in the most positive manner in
the House of Lords that Russia had
ever required from the Sultan the dismissal
of his minister Fuad Effendi;
or that the resignation of that minister
was voluntary. The repeated
warnings in the public press, the official
communications of his own agents
in Turkey and Russia, went for nothing.
The intentions of the Emperor
of Russia were in his eyes moderate
and pacific, even so late as the end of
April. The arrogant language of the
Russian Envoy at Constantinople, the
menaced occupation of the Principalities,
were, because Count Nesselrode
pronounced them to be so, not merely
exaggerated, but “destitute of any
foundation whatever.” The “<i><span lang="fr">beau
rôle</span></i>” which the wily chancellor of
the Russian Empire congratulated
Lord Aberdeen for having preferred,
was in point of fact the meanest subservience;
and we are satisfied that
it was to the conviction that this
“<i><span lang="fr">beau rôle</span></i>”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a> was to be played out
to the end, that we owe all that has
since taken place. The same truckling
spirit characterised even those
acts of the Government which had the
appearance of energy. When our
ships entered the Dardanelles, and
anchored before Constantinople, the
country was made to believe that
their presence in the Bosphorus had
no reference to the acts of Russia, but
to the protection of British subjects
and property, and to the defence of
the Sultan from the violence of his
own subjects at a moment when it
was known that not the slightest danger
menaced either the one or the
other. Abdul Medjid must have felt
indignant at the imputation thus cast
by his friends on the loyalty of his
subjects, and even Lord Aberdeen’s
own ambassador declined to accept
such an explanation of movement of
the fleet without a pretext. Lord
Stratford de Redcliffe, while expressing
his thanks for the interest taken
by the British Government in the
preservation of British life and property
at Constantinople, said, at the
same time, that he applied his gratitude
also to that part of the instructions
which authorised him to consider
the presence of her Majesty’s squadron,
if he thought proper to require
it, as intended to embrace the protection
of the Sultan in case of need: from
whom the Sultan most needed protection,
no man knew better than the
English ambassador. The defence set
up for the delays, the hesitations, and
the inaction of the Aberdeen Cabinet,
was, it seems, the doubt entertained
of the co-operation of France. Now,
nothing is more clearly shown, even
in the <cite>Blue Books</cite>, that the contrary
was the fact. It is proved by the
despatches of the French Ambassador
in London, and of the English Ambassador
in Paris. They show, beyond
the possibility of doubt, not only
that such was not the case, but that
every proposition of active measures,
from the very beginning when the
squadrons appeared in the Bay of
Salamis to their entering the Black
Sea, originated exclusively with the
French Government. The despatch
of Lord Cowley of the 28th January
confirmed the intelligence published in
the London papers, that it was the
French Government who had invited
the English to join the French fleet in
the expedition to the Greek waters,
and the fact is corroborated in the
despatch of the French Minister of
Foreign Affairs to his ambassador in
London, dated the 5th June. Again,
on the 13th July the French Ambassador
proposed to Lord Clarendon
that, in the event of Russia not
accepting the Vienna note, or showing
a disposition to persist in a violent
policy, the French and English fleets
should forthwith enter the Dardanelles.
That proposition was repeated
in the beginning of September by the
French Government; and once more,
on the 23d of the same month, Count
Walewski urged the presence of the
fleets in the Black Sea as <em>indispensable</em>.
On this important point there was
not the slightest divergence of opinion
between the head of the French
Government and his Minister of Foreign
Affairs; their views were the
same, their opinions identical; and
the <cite>Blue Books</cite> prove no fact to be
more indisputable, more certain, than
that their conduct throughout the
whole of the affair was frank and
straightforward. It is not alone in
the French despatches that we find
this proof. We see it in the correspondence
of Lord Aberdeen and Lord
Cowley. The latter noble lord, who
had the best opportunity of ascertaining
the truth, and who is not a person
to be easily deceived, repeatedly informs
his Government that he invariably
received from the Emperor, or
from his minister, the same assurances
of a desire to act in concert and in
cordial alliance with England, and
that he never could discover, though
he was evidently on the watch, the
slightest difference between them.
It is all very well to say that the
time which has been spent in, as it
now appears, useless negotiation, has
not been lost, and that the Government
has been enabled to prepare the
means of resisting the encroachments
of Russia, and of wresting from her
the territory she has seized. It is a
poor defence to allege that fortune has,
after all, favoured us, and that we are
not in so bad a condition as we might
have been. A blunder is not the less
a blunder because its results are not
so mischievous as they might be. But
if we are prepared at this moment, as
there can be little doubt, the credit is
not due to Ministers, who have exhibited
throughout a credulity and a
simplicity we believe to be unexampled.
We have no reason to
believe that if, in the very commencement,
a firm and imposing attitude had
been assumed by our Government, the
Emperor of Russia would not have
recoiled before he had yet placed himself
in a position, to retire from which,
without striking a blow, is shame and
dishonour. Had it been announced
that the squadrons would enter the
Black Sea the moment the Russians
crossed the Pruth, we believe that that
passage would not have taken place,
and in that menace we are confident
that France would have joined us.</p>

<p class='c009'>On perusing the despatches published
by the French Government in
its official organ, we have been particularly
struck by the clearness of
views and the intrepidity, mingled
with good sense, which pervade them.
From the moment that the question
assumed a more general character;
when it ceased to refer exclusively
to French interests, we remark the
masterly view which the Emperor’s
minister of foreign affairs took of the
whole question as it then stood; of
the accuracy with which he judged of
the future conduct of the Czar, and the
marked line of conduct which he proposed
to follow. Yet the difficulties
in the way of the French Government
were great. With the cunning
which distinguishes the policy of
Russia, this power had the tact to
present the Eastern question, from
the outset, in a light most disadvantageous
to France; and the excessive
zeal and indiscretion of M. de Lavalette
indisposed the other powers,
and afforded a pretext to our own
Government to stand aloof. In
this country the policy and person
of the French Emperor had been unpopular.
With the prejudice, mistrust,
and ill-feeling which his name
inspired, it is not to be wondered at
that all his acts were viewed with
suspicion; and the question of the
holy places was at once, and as this
result has shown, unfairly interpreted
as the forerunner of new and more important
pretensions,—as the continuation,
in fact, of the plans of his uncle,
whose hostility to England he was
supposed to have inherited with his
crown. It was at the moment of the
invasion panic—which was so far useful
that it roused us to strengthen our
defences, and organise a naval and
military force which we then little
thought would be employed against
Russia—that the French minister at
Constantinople succeeded in obtaining
immunities in favour of the Latin
church, of which France assumed to
be the protector. We will not now examine
whether these privileges were of
the exorbitant and unjust character
ascribed to them. It is sufficient that
they were so considered by Russia,
and that the advantages extorted from
the Porte for the monks of the holy
cities were understood as placing the
Greek communion in a condition of
relative inferiority, and as realising a
triumph over Russia in those places
where she had long reigned supreme,
and where she would brook no rival,
much less a superior. From such a
quarrel between rival churches, with
the dogmas of which we had nothing
in common, England properly kept
apart, and France was left to find her
own way, unaided, out of the unpleasant
position in which her agents had
placed her. No moment could be
more propitious to Russia, ever watchful
as she has always been of dissension
between the Western powers,
and ever ready to take advantage of
it. The French Government soon
saw and met the danger. Its ambassador
was recalled and disavowed.
Explanations were promptly and
frankly given, and readily received;
and M. de Nesselrode himself, however
disappointed or checked, was
forced to admit that these explanations
were perfectly satisfactory, and
that the redress obtained in favour of
the Latins was not of a nature to
trench upon the immunities of the
Greeks. That admission completely
closed the question of the Holy Places,
in which France was exclusively interested.
But scarcely had it terminated
when the mission of Prince
Menschikoff assumed all at once a
strange and startling aspect. It was
soon seen that the holy places were
but the mask which covered pretensions
of far greater moment. The
French Government, struck by the
haughty and menacing tone of the
Russian envoy, quickly understood
the true cause of the vast military
preparations of Russia, and became
aware that they were the prelude to
a state of things which would endanger
the independence of the Sultan and
the security of his states. It considered
that France was bound by
the Treaties of 1841, to which she was
a party, as well as by her position in
Europe, not to regard with indifference
the proceedings of Russia; and,
as a precautionary measure, it ordered
the Mediterranean fleet to proceed
on the 20th March to the Greek
waters, and to remain there until
further events rendered a nearer approach
to the Sultan’s capital necessary.
When that order was issued,
France alone declared its belief in the
grave and threatening character of
the pretensions of the Czar. Austria
affected to give credit to the repeated
assurances of Russian moderation,
and continued to keep aloof; and
Lord Aberdeen, whose attention had
been drawn by the public press, and,
no doubt, by his own agents, to the
coming storm, could perceive no cloud,
no angry speck in the political horizon.
The French Government, as is proved
by the despatches in the <cite><span lang="fr">Moniteur</span></cite>,
persisted in its conviction that the
most serious dangers were at hand;
and that Russia believed that the
long-expected moment had arrived
for realising her traditional policy in
the East—the annihilation of the
Ottoman Empire, or its absorption,
by the process of previous degradation.
France considered that, under
such circumstances, complete obstruction
was impossible, and that, so far
as England was concerned, the necessity
of maintaining her maritime
superiority ought to be a sufficient
motive for her participation in a more
active policy. The instructions to
M. de Lacour, dated the 22d March,
presupposed the adherence of the
British Government to that policy;
the co-operation of the English
squadron was anticipated for months
previously; and, in his despatch of
the 3d June, M. Drouyn de Lhuys
presumed that the policy of the
French Cabinet would soon become
that of the Powers who were equally
if not more interested than France in
the maintenance of the Treaties of
1841. This energetic conduct, and
the conviction which began to creep
over the slow mind of Lord Aberdeen,
produced some effect. On the 3d
June the English squadron received
orders similar to those of the French,
and at length it sailed for Besica Bay.
In the course of the same month,
Austria and Prussia, roused to a sense
of the impending danger, mustered courage
enough to show symptoms of resistance
to the pretensions of Russia,
and in the month of July these two
Powers united with England and
France in the Vienna note, with the
avowed object of maintaining peace.
We are bound to admit that throughout
this operation the French Government
acted in a manner that redounds
to its honour, and that subsequent
events have fully justified its original
apprehensions and precautions. The
Vienna note was very properly regarded
by the Divan as leaving a
door open to the encroachments of
Russia. The instinct of impending
danger rendered the Porte more acute
than usual, and its fears, which had
been termed puerile, were completely
justified by the commentary of M. de
Nesselrode, who accepted the note for
the same reasons that made the
Sultan reject it. The plenipotentiaries
were confounded (or at least affected
to be so) on learning that the elaborate
state paper, which had been
so carefully worded, and which had
stood the scrutinising glance and the
keen criticism of the collective statesmanship
of the Four Cabinets, was, in
point of fact, nothing less than the
Menschikoff <i><span lang="fr">ultimatum</span></i>, which had
been indignantly rejected by the same
conference that adopted the Vienna
note. Matters now became more complicated
and alarming. The war which
began to rage on the banks of the
Danube, with every prospect of a long
duration, produced its fatal effects on
the commerce of western Europe;
and as the hope of preserving peace
became weaker each day, the union of
the four great Powers was found to be
more necessary. The consequence of
this resolution was a new conference,
which opened on the 5th December
1853. The note of the 13th January
was the result. It was, no doubt,
intended as the bond by which the
Powers pledged themselves to act together
for the peace of Europe; for,
notwithstanding the suspicious conduct
of Austria, it was clear that she,
even more than any other, was interested
in resisting any attempt to
violate international law. The French
Government acted throughout this
affair with much prudence, foresight,
and loyalty. We have it on record
that Louis Napoleon and his Government
saw from the commencement
the aim of Russia, and fully appreciated
the grave and alarming character
of the events which were preparing
in the East. The Emperor of the
French had, as we have said, been
exposed to a great deal of obloquy in
this country. He had encountered
the sullenness or hostility of our
Government; he had to contend with
the intrigues of political parties in
France, the most selfish and unprincipled
of all, the <em>Fusionists</em>; and he
exhibited throughout the sagacity
which foresaw, and the judgment
which estimated, the full importance
of the situation—as well as the courage
to face it. He who had been suspected
of a design to trample all
obligations under foot, to disregard
faith and honour, stood forth boldly,
first, and alone, to defend the inviolability
of treaties; and he summoned
the nations of Europe to co-operate
with him. Insulted by suspicions of
his good faith, and baffled in his
attempts to conciliate his enemies, he
yet did not abandon the task he had
undertaken. He at length succeeded
in bringing over England. Austria
and Prussia, ever timorous, hesitating,
and slow, inclined to the manly
policy of which France had set the
example, and the question of the
Holy Places, which had been confined
to Russia and France, soon lost its
original character, and assumed another,
which now interests and agitates
the whole of the European
continent. We live in strange times!
One of the strangest events to which
the Eastern question has given rise
is, that Napoleon III.—the “idiot,”
as a noble lord in the present Cabinet
was wont to call him—the penniless
adventurer, the man regardless of all
ties, of all faith, should be the person
to remind the Conservative Governments
of Europe of the treaties they
themselves had framed, and to summon
them to execute them faithfully.
Louis Napoleon is no longer an outcast;
nor is France isolated. His
alliance, on the contrary, is courted;
and among his former foes are some
who find no terms too extravagant to
celebrate his disinterestedness and his
loyalty. The French despatches do
honour to the sovereign who inspired,
and the minister who drew them up;
and they are in every respect worthy
of the great nation whose title to our
friendship is, that she has been the
most formidable and honourable of
our enemies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Foresight, moderation, and firmness
are, as we have observed, the
characteristics of French policy in the
Eastern question. In these despatches
we see the French minister anticipate
the moment when negotiation would
become fruitless, and when all honourable
mode of arrangement would be
rejected by Russia. In its earlier
stages we find the French ambassador
in London, earnestly and repeatedly
urged to come to an understanding
with the English Cabinet on the conduct
which, in such an emergency, it
would be necessary to adopt. It is to
the repeated instances of M. Drouyn
de Lhuys we owe it, that identical
instructions were given to M. de
Lacour and Lord Stratford de Redcliffe,
which directed that the fleets
should enter the Dardanelles if the
Russians did not evacuate the Principalities
which they had invaded. Yet
the fatal hesitation of Lord Aberdeen
may be traced even in the resolves of
the French minister. In the decided
measure adopted by M. Drouyn de
Lhuys, there appeared an unwillingness
to break off rudely with Russia.
In his despatch of the 1st September,
that minister informs Count Walewski,
that the presence of the fleets at the
entrance of the Dardanelles—<em>outside
the castles</em>—if demanded by the Porte—was
rather a measure of precaution
against the weather, than an encouragement
to the Porte in its refusal to
the reasonable demands of Russia.
It may be that such a declaration was
with a view to allay any alarm which
might be felt by the German states
at the onward movement of the fleet.
We find additional evidence of the
unwillingness to occasion fresh embarrassment
in the cause assigned for
the first appearance of a detachment
of the squadron before Constantinople.
That pretext was the apprehension of
insurrection against the Sultan by
the <em>Ulemas</em>, and the massacre of the
Christian population. We have no
doubt that there was considerable dissatisfaction
manifested by the Turks
at the delays of their <i><span lang="fr">soi-disant</span></i> allies;
and that there existed much irritation
at the conduct of the western Courts,
who had advised the Porte to resist
the demands of Russia; excited it to
use all the means at its disposal to
maintain that resistance; and who,
when Turkey was left exposed to the
wrath of her formidable enemy, still
lingered at the mouth of the Dardanelles.
But we look in vain for satisfactory
proofs of the plots of insurrection
and massacre attributed to the
Mussulman population, and assigned
as the cause of the presence of the
fleets at Constantinople. We regard
the whole thing as one of those paltry
subterfuges, of which we find so many
instances throughout this proceeding.
Nothing was, however, gained by it;
and neither the Emperor of Russia
nor the public was deceived. The
Christian population of Stamboul
showed no sign of apprehension, and
we have reason to believe that they
disclaimed, so far as they were concerned,
any such motive. The Turks
were offended at being accused of a
crime which they had not contemplated,
and outraged by being falsely
accused by Christians of treason to
their own sovereign. With the arrival
of the fleets before Constantinople
vanished the danger of the Christians,
of which, however, they were perfectly
unconscious; as also of the Sultan,
who, though informed that the vengeance
of his subjects had placed his
crown and life in danger, yet, in all
the consciousness of security, had not
ceased for a single day to appear in
public, in the streets and public places
where the population is in greatest
number;—that population which our
Ministers pretended to believe was
watching the first favourable occasion
to depose or assassinate him.
He never failed to pray at the stated
hours in the <em>mosque</em>, where the plotting
<em>Ulemas</em> and the fanatical <em>Softas</em> explained
or studied the Koran. Not
only no insult was offered to him in
word, act, or perhaps thought; but
his Highness was on all occasions received
with the same respect, reverence,
and affection which Abdul-Medjid,
ever since his accession to the
throne, has proved himself deserving of.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fleets having gone up for a
special service, which they were not
called upon to perform, the next question
was, what was to be done with
them, and where they should go next?
An extract from the despatch of M.
Drouyn de Lhuys to Count Walewski,
of 4th September, shows the anxiety
of the French Government to get as
quickly as possible out of the awkward
position in which their assent to that
contemptible policy placed them. The
French minister took up the matter
with courage, and like a man of business:—“The
question now is to determine
as to the employment of our
naval forces. The Emperor is of
opinion that our fleet is destined to
play an important part in the defence
of the Ottoman empire. It might
serve to cover Constantinople, and to
operate, if necessary, on the western
coast of the Black Sea, as far up as
Varna,” &#38;c. This plan was not,
however, executed. Some difficulty
arose on the part of Austria and Prussia,
and these powers did not think,
notwithstanding the intended massacre
of the Christians and the deposition
of the Sultan, that the appearance of
the combined forces in the Bosphorus,
much less their entry into the Black
Sea, was sufficiently called for. Whether
right or wrong, their influence
arrested the further proceedings,
which, if we are to credit M. Drouyn
de Lhuys, had been already contemplated
by the Emperor of the French.
The fleets of France and England remained,
therefore, in a state of inactivity
near the Golden Horn, and
negotiations again commenced. New
collective notes were drawn up, and
the idea of another quadruple intervention,
with, of course, a view to a
pacific solution, was again revived.
The prospect grew brighter. The inexorable
Czar appeared to take pity
on our Cabinet; to smile graciously
on the minister of the “<i><span lang="fr">beau rôle</span></i>,”
the gentle and confiding friend of
Nesselrode. The Emperor of Russia,
whose preparations were not as yet
complete, showed a disposition to
treat; and, false throughout, gave
assurances that he would not assume
the offensive on any point. “Our
latest intelligence,” says M. Drouyn
de Lhuys, so recently as the 15th
December—“our latest intelligence
from St Petersburg is to the effect
that Russia is resolved to treat, and,
above all, to adopt no offensive measures,
and our confidence in this may
suffice to explain the inactivity of the
fleets.” But the pacific declarations
of Russia, which we fear M. Castelbajac
too readily believed, were but
the cloak under which the attack on
the Turkish squadron of Sinope, and
the massacre which followed, were
concealed. With such a deed perpetrated
at so short a distance from the
spot where the flags of England and
France were floating together, the
fleets could not linger any more in
the Bosphorus. They entered the
Black Sea, and what was termed <em>a
policy of action</em> commenced. Prussia
and Austria were startled from their
propriety, but they still followed on
in the pursuit of that peace which,
when nearest, always eluded their
grasp,—and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Like the circle bounding earth and skies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Allures from far, yet, as they follow, flies.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The attitude of France and England
became more decided, and at length,
after much hesitation, the Russian
ambassadors were recalled from Paris
and London.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of the long operation
which preceded the rupture of diplomatic
relations, the judgment of M.
Drouyn de Lhuys appeared nowhere
to greater advantage than in the accuracy
with which he divined and
unmasked the real designs of the Czar
in the matter of the Holy Shrines,
while our noble Premier looked on
credulous and confiding. The anger
of the Czar, so much out of proportion
to the offence, had, to be sure,
something suspicious in it, and to the
uninitiated or unsuspecting was utterly
inexplicable. M. Drouyn de Lhuys
knew well the cause of that immense
wrath. It was not on account of
the miserable squabbles of Latin and
Greek monks that vast bodies of
troops traversed the plains of southern
Russia, that stores sufficient for
an immense army and for a long campaign
were accumulated in the magazines
of Odessa, and that vast preparations
were made at Sebastopol.</p>

<p class='c009'>The absorbing interest which attached
to events in western Europe
since the revolution of 1848—the revolution
which had convulsed nearly
every Continental state—had occupied
the public mind to the exclusion
of everything else; and Russia availed
herself of the storm which raged
everywhere, except in her own territory,
to realise her aggressive projects.
Her political and religious influence
had long been paramount at Constantinople.
The arrival of M. de Lavalette
first threatened to disturb that monopoly.
Indeed, any allusion, however
slight, to the capitulation of 1741,
instantly alarmed Russia; and Prince
Menschikoff, finding that the secret of
the Czar was discovered, hastened to
present his ultimatum, with all the
aggravating and insulting circumstances
already known. The French
Government explained at length to
the Cabinet of St Petersburg the motives
and the extent of the French
demands with reference to the Holy
Places; but the Head of the Orthodox
Church refused to listen—he would
bear no rival in the East. “There is
established,” said M. Drouyn de Lhuys
in his despatch of the 21st March to
General Castelbajac, “an important
political usage in Europe. It consists
in this, that the Powers interest themselves
in common in certain general
interests, and overcome, by means of
their diplomacy, difficulties which at
another period could only be terminated
by force of arms. Be so good,
then, General, as to demand of M. de
Nesselrode if the Cabinet of St Petersburg,
repudiating the principle which
has prevailed for thirty years in the
relations of the great Powers with each
other, means to constitute itself the
sole arbiter of the destinies of Turkey,
and if for that common policy, to which
the world is indebted for its repose,
Russia means to substitute a policy of
isolation and domination which would
necessarily constrain the other Cabinets
in the approaching crisis to consult
only their own interests, and to
act only with a view to their private
views.” Russia did not choose to
comprehend the full significance of
that intimation; and though she
herself had often been among the first
to solicit a European combination
when there appeared a chance of her
deriving advantage from it, she yet
haughtily rejected the proposal when
it crossed, or did not promote, her ambition.
Her great object was to treat
with Turkey <em>without the intervention
of a third party</em>; and it was the arrogant
manner in which she met the
advances of the Western Powers, or
rather forbade them to meddle in what
she regarded as a domestic quarrel
between a vassal and his master, that
attracted general attention to the
question, and gave it a European
character. We find no point more
strongly insisted on by M. Drouyn
de Lhuys, in his despatches to General
Castelbajac, than not permitting Russia
to assume this exclusive right of
dictating her will on the Oriental
question. It is superfluous to say
that France had no intention of excluding
her from a fair share; but beyond
that she would not go. Fearing
the probability of a cordial union between
England and France—an event
which, so long as Lord Aberdeen
directed the affairs of state, he would
not believe possible—the whole force
of the Emperor’s policy was directed
to prevent it, or break it off if it had
been already formed. Heretofore the
Czar had fully approved the conduct
of his noble friend, and we find more
than once, in the papers laid before
Parliament, the warm expression of
imperial gratitude. Happy minister!
It falls to the lot of few to be enabled
to boast of such certificates of conduct
as those from Louis Philippe
in 1846, and from Nicholas in 1853.
It is true that the excellent qualities
so much admired rendered it
easy for a hypocrite to overreach,
and an overbearing despot to insult,
England. The English and
French alliance must be broken off at
any cost. The insults to the French
Emperor, and the French people, were
still ringing in the ears of the public.
The impertinencies of two members of
the Aberdeen Cabinet—the wriggling
of miserable sycophancy which met
with the contempt it merited—when
alluding to the ruler of France, were
fresh in the memory of all. The invasion
fever had not been entirely
allayed; the old suspicions of the insincerity
of the French Government,
and the jealousies and hatreds which
had been dormant, might again be
roused. France must be isolated,
and the partisans of the Orleans family,
the “Fusionists,” or by whatever
nickname they are known, already
exulted in the shame which
they invoked at the hand of a foreign
despot on their own country. The
Chancellor of the Russian Empire
brought all his ability to the task.
He accused France of ambition, and
reproached her with being the cause
of the quarrel by her conduct in the
question of the Holy Places. The
point was a sore one, as, however disingenuously
it was revived by Russia,
it was nevertheless a fact that the
quarrel followed hard on the demands
of M. de Lavalette. M. de Nesselrode,
with true Muscovite candour, omitted
to add that he himself had expressed
his satisfaction and approbation of the
fair and honourable manner in which
the French Government had brought
that question to an issue. That account
had been finally closed. A
considerable portion of the despatches
of M. Drouyn de Lhuys is taken up
with a refutation of those charges,
and it is admitted on all hands that
his refutation of them is satisfactory
and complete. With the history of
Russian aggression for the last century
before us, the charge of ambition
against another power was strange in
the mouth of a Russian minister. But
the capitulation of 1741, which confirmed
the previous immunities of the
Latin communion in the East, were
not, after all, of a nature to offend or
alarm any one. The sort of protectorate
which they established, was
not menacing to any power in Europe,
inasmuch as they applied to
establishments which were under the
protection of all alike; whilst the Greek
protectorate was of the most exclusive
character, and, as has been shown
in a previous article, was not religious,
but political, and aimed at placing the
whole Ottoman Empire at the feet of
Russia.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another point which M. Drouyn
de Lhuys has handled successfully, is
that which relates to the difference in
the measures adopted in common by
France and England, when affairs
reached a most alarming point, and
those which Russia, in the impatience
of her ambition, adopted, at the very
outset. In the despatch of the 11th
June, General Castelbajac is enjoined
to apprise the Russian Government
of the position in which it was about
to place itself with respect to the rest
of Europe; to warn it that it was
grievously mistaken if it counted upon
allies in the realisation of its designs,
and particularly upon the German
states. Indeed, it was not probable
that these states would see with indifference
the Lower Danube in the
possession of a powerful government,
which might at will obstruct its navigation,
and at any moment block up
a commercial outlet of so much importance.
The French Minister clearly
showed that the conduct of Russia
was in opposition to the general interests
of Europe; and that the realisation
of the doctrines of the Russian
Chancellor meant, in point of fact,
the subjugation of the weaker states
to the will of one great power. The
replies of M. de Nesselrode are, of
course, replete with the same pacific
declarations which had produced so
soporific an effect on our own Government,
and with solemn denials of ambitious
views, which present a curious
contrast with the warlike preparations
which were never for a moment
suspended except by difficulties independent
of the will of Russia. It was
soon seen that, <i><span lang="fr">coûte qui coûte</span></i>, Russia
was determined not to give way.
Smooth and hypocritical, like a thief
at the bar, who profits by the scantiness
of the evidence at first brought
against him, earnestly to protest
his innocence, she became bold, insolent,
and defying, like the same culprit
when accumulated proofs leave no
doubt of his guilt. There are some
despatches that have not been inserted
in the <em>Moniteur</em>, but we have
little doubt that the omitted ones are
not less moderate, less firm, and not
less characterised by good sense and
dignity, than those we have noticed;
and if any such doubt existed, the
ultimatum, which was at once followed
by a complete rupture of diplomatic
relations, would suffice to remove it.
Towards the close of December all
was over. The massacre of Sinope
had taken place, and no further hope
remained of obtaining any satisfactory
result from a power which, in its diplomacy
as its hostility, appeared to
have all at once lost every sentiment
of truth, justice, and humanity. The
autograph letter of the Emperor Napoleon
is little more than a summary
of the despatch of the 25th December,
of the notes addressed to M. de Kisseleff
before his departure from Paris,
and of the last letter of M. Drouyn
de Lhuys to the French ambassador
at St Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c009'>We believe the Emperor of Russia
to have been led into his present difficult
position—a position from which
escape, unless through a disastrous
war, seems almost impossible—by the
erroneous information he received
with respect to the state of public
feeling in France and England, from
“antiquated imbecilities” of both
countries. In ordinary times it would
be no easy task to so impose on any
person of intelligence, even much
inferior to that of the Emperor Nicholas;
and his facility of belief in the
present instance can only be explained
by the social and political complications
supposed to exist in a country
which has gone through so many violent
changes. Under the regime of
Louis Philippe, the female diplomatists
of the Rue St Florentin were
enabled to ascertain with accuracy,
and communicate with fidelity, the
secret policy of the Tuileries. In the
Russian <em>salons</em> of Paris, the centre
of the more important <em>espionage</em>,
were nightly assembled ministers, ex-ministers,
functionaries past and present,
and, in fine, all who, in official
parlance, were supposed to represent
France. The secrets, the gossip, the
scandal of every political coterie in
the capital, were discharged, there, as
in one common reservoir; and were
thence transmitted for the information,
or amusement, of the Imperial
Court of Russia. The ministers of
the citizen-king were too eager to
propitiate the favour of the northern
Court, to withhold their confidence
from any of the Czar’s agents, official
or non-official. The revolution of
February rudely interfered with that
machinery, directed by a well-known
<i><span lang="fr">intrigante</span></i>. Attendance at a half-dozen
saloons no longer sufficed to
obtain a knowledge of the state of
the country. Whilst a dozen dowagers
of the old schools, and as many
retired, discontented, or broken-down
statesmen, and a few amateur republicans,
were indulging in reveries of
a restoration, or the re-establishment
of a convention, with its appendages
of committees of public safety, the
dream was broken by the acclamations
of millions, who bestowed absolute
power on the only man capable
of saving them. The Cabinet of St.
Petersburg could not be expected to
know more about the country than
those who had for so many years administered
its affairs. The agents of
Russia beheld the struggle that had
been going on so long among political
coteries, the selfish disputes of discarded
placemen, and their ephemeral
and hollow reconciliations; and they
supposed that, because adventurers
quarrelled, or political coteries made
war on each other, the nation was
similarly divided. The diplomatic
communications of that period must
be curious; and we confess we should
like to be permitted a perusal of the
confidential correspondence of the
well-known <i><span lang="fr">diplomate</span></i> in petticoats,
who for so many years was the pet
agent of the Czar, and for whom existence
was valueless unless passed in
the atmosphere of political intrigue,
to which it had been so long accustomed.
When speaking of confidential
correspondence, we do not, of
course, allude to those indecent libels
penned daily in the French capital;
and, we regret to say, with the knowledge,
or under the superintendence,
of persons who, though known for
profligacy in private life, were the
confidential companions and bosom
friends of personages whose praises
we have heard, even to satiety, for
austerity of morals, and who are held
up as samples of every public and
private virtue. Those chroniclers of
scandal spared neither sex, nor age,
nor rank. The meanest agency was
set to work to furnish amusement for
the <em>Cabinet</em> of the Czar during his
hours of recreation; and to record
stories and anecdotes in the style and
manner of <i><span lang="fr">Taillement des Réaux</span></i>, the
<i><span lang="fr">Œil de Bœuf</span></i>, or the <i><span lang="fr">Chevalier de
Faublas</span></i>. With such unerring guides,
it is no wonder that the Czar believed
that the propitious moment
was come. It was represented to
him that the Court of Paris was more
corrupt, more profligate, than that of
Louis XV.; that all France was impoverished,
degraded, and discontented,
anxious to throw off the yoke
of the Buonaparte, eager to receive a
sovereign flung to it by any foreign
despot; or, at all events, utterly incapable
of resisting any encroachment,
much less avenging any insult
from abroad. The ruler of France,
he was told, was overwhelmed by the
difficulties that naturally encompass
every government in its commencement.
His declaration of the <em>pacific</em>
policy of the empire was but the unwilling
avowal of his weakness, and
of his fears. The agitation of political
parties, he believed, ruined the
country, though, since 1789, political
intrigues, secret societies, and conspiracies
never were more powerless
than at the moment we speak of.
The agents who thus instructed the
Emperor of Russia crowned those reports
by depicting Louis Napoleon
as apathetic, because they saw him
calm; as hesitating and timid, because
they saw him patient and moderate.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have no doubt that the Emperor
of Russia was led into similar
error with respect to this country.
He was assured that it had become
selfish and apathetic from its unexampled
prosperity; and that so opulent
and so sensual a nation would
never expose itself, after so long a
peace, to the chances and the dangers
of a long war, for the sake of maintaining
the integrity and independence
of an empire whose people preferred
the Koran to the Bible. Their
commercial prudence, the love of ease
engendered by opulence, the long
period of time that passed since the
wars with the first Napoleon, the many
important interests which have grown
up since then, religious antipathy—everything,
in fact—indisposed the
English nation to interfere with his designs
in Turkey. But the presence in
the Government of a statesman, recently
so ridiculed and insulted by those
who were now his colleagues, believed
to be a warm admirer of the
Emperor of Russia, and known for
his cold hatred of the Emperor of the
French, was considered the most
fortunate circumstance of all; it was,
at any rate, a guarantee against
any favourable understanding with
France or her ruler. Letters, said
to be from that statesman, addressed
to one of the former ministers
of Louis Philippe, were read in one
of the principal Russian saloons in
Paris, the most notorious of all for
intrigues, and the resort of the leaders
of every anti-national party. These
letters, asserted to be genuine, are
described as having alluded in terms
of the greatest contempt to the person,
the character, and the intellect of
Louis Napoleon; and as containing
declarations that, under no circumstances
whatever, could England act
with France so long as its present
regime lasted. The scum of the Orleanist
agency were sent round to circulate
the news, and despatches addressed
to St Petersburg repeated the
same. The tone of a portion of the
daily press in England with reference
to France seemed to confirm those
assurances, and to render the formation
of a coalition against the French
Emperor, in which it was hoped England
would join, by no means a
difficult nor an improbable task. The
falsest of all these calculations was
unquestionably that which represented
England as labouring under an oppression
of wealth, a plethora of opulence,
of which indifference, timidity,
and inaction were the consequences.
Yet such is the description given of
us to Russia by Orleanists, whose incapacity
and cowardice produced the
overthrow of the dynasty of July.
The acquisition of wealth and power
supposes the possession of great energy
of character; for those qualities we
have been distinguished above all
other people. That we have not become
wearied or satiated, the events
of each day that passes over our heads
prove; and whatever be the period
at which we are destined to reach the
declining point, and which such scribblers
as Ledru Rollin and the like
maintain we have attained, we ourselves
believe that the fatal moment
is still far distant. We have shown
energy without example, since the
time of the Romans, in making ourselves
what we are; and we are ready
to let the world see that we know how
to maintain the power which was
supposed to have enervated us, with
more than Roman courage. With
admitted social and political evils—far
less, however, than any other nation
on earth—we have not become corrupt
or effeminate. It is not true that the
extraordinary development of our
public and private fortune has buried
us in that shameful indolence which
made the Romans so easy a prey to
the barbarians. Prosperity has not
made us forget or disregard our
rights. The wonderful development
of our railway communications and
our steam navigation, the extension
of our commerce, the pacification of
India, the colonisation of Africa,
ought to have shown the Emperor of
Russia that we have not yet fallen
from our high estate in the political
or moral world. The mighty fleets
and the gallant bands of warriors
that are even now conveying to him
our answer to his insolent defiance,
will show him the magnitude of his
error. Our courage and our activity,
our resolution in council, and our
sternness in execution, are in proportion
to the grandeur of the interests
we have to defend. Our decline,
much less our fall, has not yet commenced;
and if any foreign or domestic
friend has persuaded Russia that
we resemble the Romans in the latter
days of their empire, and that we are
in a condition to fall a prey to the
barbarians, he is an idiot or a calumniator.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing is now so clear as that the
Emperor of Russia has been most
grossly deceived with respect to Turkey;
but it is just to admit that the
error has been also shared by many
who should know better. Prince
Menschikoff, during his short sojourn
at Constantinople, had only time to
insult the Sultan and his government,
but also time to rouse a spirit of resentment
and resistance. The backwardness
of Turkey in civilisation was
taken as a proof of her weakness and
her deficiency in moral courage. But,
with all her shortcomings, the old
Mussulman spirit still subsisted amid
the ruins of her former glory. It has
been said that there are qualities which
are effaced or destroyed by refinement,
but there are others which live without
it, though the occasion may have
seldom occurred to call them forth.
Turkish patriotism was regarded as a
byword, Turkish loyalty as a mockery;
Turkish courage was more than
doubtful; and nothing remained of
the daring valour which, in other
times, made Christendom quail before
the Crescent, except that vigour
of faith which once distinguished the
children of the Prophet: and even
that, we were led to believe, had degenerated
into a brutal and ignoble
fanaticism, capable of vulgar crime,
but unequal to a single act of heroism.
The arrogant envoy of Russia rendered
an essential service, not to his imperial
master, but to his intended victim.
His insults roused the dormant spirit
of the Mussulman. The Ottoman
army was undisciplined—unprovided
with the commonest necessaries; the
navy was but the melancholy remnant
of Navarino; the Sultan’s authority
was weakened by internal abuses and
disorders; his territory dismembered
by the separation of Greece, and by
the all but successful rebellion of
Egypt. Those to whom he looked
for aid or protection against his
colossal foe were long cold, if not
hostile to him; yet Turkey rose with
a courage and a dignity which have
extorted applause, and won respect,
even from those who were most indisposed
to her cause, politically and
religiously. She summoned her children
about her; appealed, <em>not</em> to the
relentless fanaticism of their creed,
but to their manlier and nobler instincts;
and after making every sacrifice,
every concession consistent with
self-respect, to appease or disarm her
unscrupulous and faithless enemy, who
was bent on her destruction, drew the
sword in the cause of her independence.
Whilst still uncertain whether she was
to maintain the struggle alone and
unsympathised with, against fearful
odds, she advanced to the contest
with a bravery worthy of better times,
and with a success which has astonished
her friends as well as foes. The
feelings which Prince Menschikoff believed
he could most safely outrage
were those which quickened the nation
into life and vigour. The Emperor
of Russia was astonished at a
result so different from what he was
led to expect. The advices which had
reached him from his friends in London,
Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and Constantinople,
were such as might have
been true some twenty years ago, but
were false in 1853. France and England
were said to be divided, and
likely to remain so as long as a Buonaparte
ruled the destinies of the former,
and as long as Lord Aberdeen directed
the administration of the latter. France
had become exhausted by revolution,
discontented with her new chief, demoralised,
and rotten at the very
heart;—no remedy to restore her, till
the Count de Chambord, or the Count
de Paris, was restored to the throne;
and with England, satiated and unwieldy
with unwholesome prosperity,
no desire remained, no passion survived,
but that of enjoying in undisturbed
tranquillity what she had hardly
acquired. Count Orloff has learned
something at Vienna; but it does not
appear that the lesson has much profited
him or his imperious master.</p>

<p class='c009'>In these multiplied and intricate transactions,
in which Russia was alternately
the deceived and the deceiver,
there is one point in particular to which
we would direct the attention of our
readers. We allude to the claim made
by the Porte to the intervention of
the great powers in its quarrel with
Russia. It is a claim based on equity
and on international law, which it is
impossible to dispute. Previous to
1841, Turkey was hardly looked upon
as forming part of the general combination
of European states in the
settlement of any great international
question. Rightly or wrongly, the
Turks were considered less as forming
an integral part of the European
family of nations, than as an agglomeration
of various tribes of warriors,
bound together only by a common
superstition and a common fanaticism;
not rooted in the soil they occupied,
but merely encamped on the
outskirts of Christendom. The Treaties
of 1841, which facilitated to France
the resumption of her place in Europe,
after her separation the previous year,
also admitted Turkey to that general
political association. That privilege
or right Turkey has not forgotten in
her hour of need, as we believe she
would have done in her hour of
prosperity; and in her appeal to
the world against the pretensions
of Russia, she summoned Austria,
France, Prussia, and Great Britain,
in the name of those solemn obligations,
to come to her aid. She maintained
that her participation in what
is termed, in diplomatic parlance, the
<i><span lang="fr">Concerte Européen</span></i>, was recognised;
and she showed, we think successfully,
that henceforth all questions
affecting the independence and integrity
of her territory should be brought
before the great tribunal of European
states, and not left to the judgment
of a single and an interested power.
The principle of the right claimed by
Turkey was admitted by the Cabinets
of Vienna, Berlin, Paris, and London;
and that recognition is manifest in
the documents that have been made
public. In the note addressed to the
Austrian Cabinet on the 31st December
1853, we find this declaration:—“The
multiplicity of the relations and
the alliances of the Sublime Porte
and of the European States, giving to
it, in every respect, the right and the
faculty of participating in the community
which binds these States to
each other, and to the security which
they derive from them, the necessity
will be felt of confirming and completing
in that sense the Treaty of
1841, and for that it reposes on the
friendly efforts of the allied Courts.”
And the allied Courts, in turn, declared,
“that the Russian Government,
which invaded the territory of
the Sultan, had placed itself in opposition
with the resolutions declared by
the great powers of Europe in 1840
and 1841. That, moreover, the spirit
of the important transaction in which
Russia took part in 1841 with the
other powers, and with Turkey herself,
is opposed to the pretension that
the affairs of the East should be
treated otherwise than in common,
and in the conferences in which all
these interests should be examined
and discussed. And it must be well
understood that every such question
must be treated by <em>five</em>; and that it
does not belong to <em>one</em> or to <em>two</em>
cabinets to settle, separately or apart,
interests which may affect the whole
of Europe.” The allies of Turkey also
added, “that the Treaty of 1841, in
the meaning of which all are this day
agreed, is to serve as the basis of
operations. All the powers who have
signed that treaty are qualified to
appeal to it. We present ourselves
as the defenders of that treaty, violated
in its spirit, and as the supporters
of the equilibrium of Europe,
menaced by the power which seemed,
more than any other, to have the
pretension of constituting herself the
guardian of it. The cause for which
we are armed is that of all.” That
claim of Turkey to form part of the
European community is precisely the
one to which Russia is inexorably
opposed. Its admission would destroy
the monopoly of interference and protection
which the Czar wishes to
maintain over Turkey, and we need
not therefore be surprised at the stern
refusals which the good offices of any
other power have invariably encountered
at St Petersburg. Russia insisted
throughout that the question
only regarded Russia and Turkey;
it denied the right of any one to interfere,
except in advising Turkey to
submit to her dictates; and to the
last she rejected all intervention or
mediation. It is true that intervention
menaced the fundamental principle
on which the traditional policy
of Russia is based; and the day that
the Treaty of 1841 forms part of the
international law of Europe, the designs
of Russia on Turkey are at once
arrested. Russia will then have lost
all exclusive rights; and all questions
of public interest affecting the Porte
must be treated by all the states who
have affixed their signatures to that
important instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are decidedly of opinion that
the view taken by Turkey of the rights
created for her by this new state of
things, is the correct one; and we
submit that the interpretation which
gives the greatest effect to the joint
engagement of the four powers, is
that which is most conformable to
the spirit and meaning of its framers.
“The important act of this Convention,”
said M. Guizot in the Chamber
of Peers, “is to have included the
Porte itself, the inviolability of the
sovereign rights of the Sultan, the repose
of the Ottoman Empire, in the
public law of Europe. Therein is comprised
the general recognition—the
recognition made in common, and officially
declared—of the inviolability of
the sovereign rights of the Porte, and
of the consolidation of the Turkish
Empire. It cannot be supposed that
France would have refused to facilitate
by her adhesion the execution of that
act.” “The Turco-Egyptian question,”
said the same minister in the
Chamber of deputies, “was settled—the
question of Constantinople remained.
What is the object the policy
of Europe has in view for a long time
past with reference to Constantinople?
It is to withdraw Constantinople from
exclusive protection; to admit Turkey
into our European law; and to prevent
her from becoming the Portugal
of Russia. Well, then, a step has
been made towards that end. It is
true that the Porte has not been secured
from ambition of all kinds—from
all the chances of the future;
but, at all events, we have an official
instrument, signed by all the great
powers of Europe, which admits
Turkey into the European law, which
declares that it is the intention of all
the great powers to respect the inviolability
of the Sultan’s rights, and to
consolidate the repose of the Ottoman
Empire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There is no doubt that Russia is
deeply interested in the possession of
Constantinople. It is equally certain
that, whenever she becomes mistress
of both shores of the Bosphorus, she
will, in an incredibly short time,
add to her present pre-eminent military
character that of a first-rate
commercial and maritime power. The
populations that would then acknowledge
the supremacy of the <i><span lang="fr">Knout</span></i>
would be over eighty millions; and
the seventy millions of Christians professing
the Greek faith would bow
their necks to the political and religious
autocrat. Russia would then
indeed hold at her girdle the keys of
the Caspian Sea, the lake of Azof,
the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean.
The possession of Syria and Egypt
would before long follow, as a matter
of course, that of Turkey in Europe;
and soon the fairest regions in the
world, the most fertile shores of that
inland sea, would fall under her rule.
A single glance at the map will enable
us to comprehend the magnificence,
the vast extent, of such an acquisition;
and the mind may dwell with wonder
on the immensity of the new Russian
Empire in Europe and Asia, and anticipate
the supremacy she would gain
by the conquest of Constantinople,
which opens to her a path to the very
heart of civilised Europe. That Russia
should make gigantic efforts, and risk,
as she is now risking, her rank as a
first-rate Power, if not her existence,
to attain such an object, is not astonishing.
The fair capital that stands
on the Bosphorus is the guarantee of
the empire of the world. It is more
than the ambition of Alexander, of
Charlemagne, or of Napoleon, ever
dreamed the realisation of; and if
treachery or violence ever gives it to
Russia, the irresistible and universal
domination of Rome over the rest of
the world, after the fall of Carthage,
alone furnishes an example of what
Russia would then become.</p>

<p class='c009'>Russia has, by the tolerance or
apathy of Europe, been singularly
favoured since the seventeenth century;
and she whose name was not even
mentioned in the Treaty of Westphalia,
which defined the limits of the
great European states, has risen to
gigantic proportions since then. She
has invariably availed herself, as she
is now ready to do, of the dissensions
of the Western kingdoms; she has absorbed
provinces and nations of various
tongues, religions, and races; and
has opened her way, through the territories
of her neighbours, to the shores
of two seas. Her hand it was that
put an end to the existence of Poland.
It was she that paralysed Sweden and
Denmark; and it is by her that Persia
and Turkey have been pushed on to
their ruin. The history of her crimes
in Poland is the same as that of her
plunder in Turkey, Georgia, and Persia;
and the partition of the ancient northern
kingdom is now to be repeated
with the Ottoman Empire. The
means she employs are ever the same;—menaces
and caresses by turns;—attempts
at exclusive intervention;—a
slow but steady system of dismemberment;—pretensions
and claims,
as impudently advanced as they are
unfounded; then apparently withdrawn,
postponed, placed in abeyance,
seemingly forgotten, but never
finally abandoned; revived with hypocritical
humility, or with arrogance,
according to circumstances; pretexts
of quarrel of the most imaginary
and untenable kind; intimidation
mingled with seduction. Nothing
is too bold, too base for her selfishness.
Her princes and nobles are
spies; her princesses—worse. No
profligacy is too gross, no crime is
too enormous, that advances by one
inch the influence of “Holy Russia.”
War is undertaken for no other object
than to arrive at conventions ruinous
to the conquered. Such is the hereditary
policy of Russia; such it has
been since she first assumed a standing
in Europe; and we say it to
our shame, that her unexampled success
is in great part owing to the selfishness
of some, the exaggerated fears
of others, and the indifference and
apathy of all the states of Europe.
If England and France had but pronounced
a <em>veto</em> in 1774, Poland might,
with a reformed constitution, and an
improved administration, still be an
independent kingdom, and stand the
barrier between the barbarism of the
north and the civilisation of the west.
If the Western Powers had directed
their attention a little more frequently,
and more earnestly to Turkey, the
events against which we are now preparing
might not have taken place.
Even now, it is not too late; and we
firmly believe that it is in the power,
as we have little doubt it is the desire,
of Europe, to arrest for many years
the aggressive policy of Russia.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have heard one argument advanced
against our interference to
save Turkey from Russia, and which
seems to have made a certain impression
in some quarters. We think the
argument to be more specious than
real; and the only reason we notice
it here is, because it has been dwelt
upon by persons whose opinions are
in other respects entitled to consideration.
We are told that it is a shame
and a scandal for a civilised and religious
nation to go to war in support
of a barbarous and unbelieving Government.
If such an argument mean
anything, it must mean that England
is to have no ally but such as can
boast of equal civilisation, and profess
the same faith as ourselves. We
deny that we go to war, and in support
of Turkey, in order to insure the
supremacy of the Koran over the
Bible, of the Crescent over the Cross,
of barbarism over civilisation. We
take the part of Turkey, not on religious
grounds, but on political; to
prevent the extension of Russia in
those parts of Europe and Asia where
her power would seriously endanger
the vital interests of Western Europe;
to maintain what is termed the balance
of Europe; or, in other words, to prevent
any one Power from growing to
such a colossal size as that all the others
would be at her mercy. We do not go
to war to continue Mussulman barbarism,
or to perpetuate the despotism
under which the Christian populations
have groaned. The conditions on
which France and England afford succour
to the Sultan are, that the reform
long since commenced by Sultan
Mahmoud, and continued by Abdul
Medjid, shall be still further developed;
and that the Christian subjects
of the Porte, whose condition
has materially improved, shall be
placed on an equality with the Mussulmans.
As well might it be said
that our wars in Spain had for their
object the protection of the Roman
Catholic religion, the consolidation of
the influence of the Pope, the re-establishment
of the Inquisition, or the
perpetuation of the stupid despotism
of Ferdinand. We entered on the
Peninsular war, not for such objects,
but for reasons similar to those which
now lead us to the East;—to rescue
the Spanish territory from the grasp
of a usurper, from the power of a
conqueror whose ambition of universal
rule was not less than that of
Nicholas; to prevent the whole of
Europe from falling under the dominion
of a single potentate. In this
country we denounce the doctrines of
the Church of Rome as contrary to
Scripture, and we, a Protestant Government,
employed its armies in defence
of a nation whose principle has
been, and still is, intolerance of all
other creeds but its own, and against
a Government which, whatever may
have been its faults, had not, at all
events, religious intolerance among
them. In no country is the Roman
Catholic religion made to assume a
more odious form than in Spain. We
are told that the Turks speak of
Christians as “dogs;” but, in Christian
Spain, English Protestants are
actually treated as dogs, or worse.
We have seen, and this within a very
few years, those who fought, and bled,
and died in the cause of Spanish independence,
flung, like offal, into a
hole, or left to rot on the sea coast
below high-water mark. We have,
within the last few months, witnessed
the tedious negotiations carried on between
our Minister at Madrid and the
Government in whose cause our blood
and treasures have been spent with
profusion, to obtain a secluded spot of
earth wherein the bones of those of
our countrymen, who still labour to
introduce civilisation into that country,
may be sheltered from pollution;
and we have no cause to rejoice at its
humiliating conclusion.  When we
are told of Turkish bigotry and intolerance,
we would point to Madrid, to
Naples, and to Tuscany. Turkish
honour and Turkish fidelity to engagements
will not suffer by a comparison
with the Government of her
most Catholic Majesty, as we presume
those Englishmen who have had
anything to do with it will be ready
to admit. We are not of opinion that
the barbarism of the Turks is greater
than that which may be found in
many parts of the Spanish peninsula;
and those who have travelled into the
interior of both countries may bear
witness to the fact that her Catholic
Majesty’s subjects, with the exception
of the large towns, cannot be surpassed
by any others in ignorance,
sloth, and bigotry. Corrupt as
the Turkish Government may have
been, and badly administered as the
country unquestionably is, we doubt
whether the general run of Spanish
statesmen have exhibited much more
probity, integrity, and talent in government,
with all the advantages of
our example; and, in the matter of
private morals, we think we could
point out Spanish sovereigns who,
with all their piety and attachment to
Catholicism, have not much to boast
over Sultan Abdul Medjid. We are
not of opinion that, as respects mere
civilisation, the Russian serfs are superior
to the Turks. We have no
evidence that Russia has made any
improvement within the recollection
of the present generation; while it is
undeniable that, within the same
space of time, Turkey had made, and
is still making, material progress in
its administration. Since the time of
Mahmoud, Turkey—though, of course,
still far behind France and England—has
effected immense ameliorations in
all matters connected with internal navigation,
with her military and naval
establishments, and her political and
judicial administration; and, from the
great improvement that has taken place
in the condition of her Christian populations,
we are confident that, before
long, she will realise the wish of Mahmoud,
and those populations will be
placed on a footing of political equality
with the Mussulmans. We doubt
whether all these things can be stated
of Russia.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Grand-duke Michael is said to
have predicted the dismemberment of
the Russian Empire soon after the
death of the present autocrat. Whatever
be the claims of that prince to
the character of a prophet, it is evident
that Russia is now approaching
a more important crisis. Russia will
give way, or she will not. If the former,
her prestige is gone, and the
pettiest Continental kingdom may regard
her with indifference. If the
latter, a more terrible fate may await
her, for she can scarcely resist all
that is powerful in Europe combined
against her. Russia has been to
Europe, for the last forty years, what
a ball remaining in an old wound is
to the limb of a veteran. Every
change of temperature, the heat of
summer, the cold of winter, produces
uneasiness and pain. The ball
must now be extracted; the wound
must now be entirely closed up, that
we may be all at rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since the preceding pages were written,
a “Confidential correspondence”
has been brought to light, which
no longer leaves any mystery in this
once incomprehensible question. Our
readers will find these important documents,
and the indefensible conduct
of the Ministry in the matter, fully
discussed in the concluding article of
this Number.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>LIFE IN THE SAHARA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Tired of poetical criticism, in which
we last month so freely indulged, and
turning with satisfaction from the political
disquisitions now going through
the press for the benefit of our sorely-perplexed
countrymen, we feel disposed,
cutting both poetry and politics,
fairly to fly our shores, and recreate
ourselves and readers in some less
troubled quarter of the earth. Among
the host of new books on our table,
redolent of Cossack and Turk, Cross
and Crescent, and here and there
interspersed with cabalistic-looking
titles, which, we are requested to
believe, signify the “Doom of Turkey,”
or the “Drying up of the
Euphrates”—lo, there peeps forth one
of a more pacific hue. There, lustrous
on its boards, rises the feathery palm-tree
of the Desert,—the Arab tent,—the
camel; and what an emblem of
peace is that cross-legged Oriental,
smoking his long pipe, imperturbable
as a statue! <i><span lang="la">Sedit æternumque sedebit.</span></i>
We open the book, and, amidst the
intricacies of a very long title, catch
the piquant words—“Wanderings in
the African Sahara.”<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a> How we feel
the breezes of the Desert come around
us!—the freedom,—the expanse,—the
wild novelty of the scene;—the
heaving motion of the camel beneath
us,—the flashing spears and pennons
of the escort, as they whirl in mimic
warfare around. Away into the
Desert! with a sea of rigid white
sand beneath, and a twin sea of glowing
light above! On, over the waste,
till the glare of day is done, and the
cool breeze comes forth, and all the
stars of night,—and we kiss our hand
to the moon “walking in brightness,”
and say, with Southey,</p>

<p class='c009'>What mystery hangs over this last-born
of continents! whose plains are
sea-beds, at whose vast upheaval the
waters of ocean must have rushed
furiously in all directions to regain
their level. A land of mystery, from
the days of Herodotus until now. How
we long to join those yearly caravans,
which, after leaving behind them the
whole northern region of the coast,
travel for sixty days southwards
through the burning Sahara,—reaching
springs but once a-week,—crossing
alternately now mountain-ridges,
now seas of sand; until, passing from
oasis to oasis, they at length penetrate
into the region of Soudaan,—the
heart of Africa, the death-place of
Clapperton, and Richardson, and
Overweg,—and behold the great central
lake of Tchad, the most inaccessible
point on the globe, yet to within
a few miles of whose shores the dying
energies of Clapperton brought a boat,—whose
waters have been navigated
by his European comrade, and on
whose bosom, perchance, that bark
still floats, with the flag of England
flying from its mast!</p>

<p class='c009'>Such were the quick musings of
the moment of imaginative pleasure
which elapsed, as we cut open
preface and contents, and plunged
into the book itself. In a trice, the
argument of the book is plain to us.
After a residence of several years on
the shores of North Africa—during
which time he seems to have mastered
the various dialects of the Arab
tribes, and of course studied their
manners—Mr Davis, the reverend
author, catches sight of an excellent
opportunity for visiting the interior.
“Sidy Mohammed Bey,” he says,
“the heir-apparent of the throne of
Tunis,—a prince possessed of excellent
qualities, among which extreme
kindness and affability are not the
least prominent,—was on the point
of making a journey into the interior,
in order to regulate some public
affairs; and, upon application, he
very kindly took me under his immediate
protection.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On the sixth day after starting,
they came to a good deal of broken
country,—traversed several dry beds
of rivers,—and crossed a number
of rugged heights, rent into strange
shapes. Marching through an opening
in one of these minor ridges, they passed
at once from a beautiful plain into the
wild and ragged outskirts of the great
chain of Gebel Waslaat, celebrated for
the warlike character of its ancient
inhabitants. “At a little distance,”
says Mr Davis, “these famous and
romantic heights have a most lovely
appearance, resembling the vineyards
of Spain and of the south of France;”
but on a nearer approach, he found—as
on many other occasions during
the expedition—that it was only distance
that lent to them their enchanting
look. The Arabs of the coast
look upon this region as perhaps the
blackest spot in all creation; and you
may as well call one of them a devil
as a <em>Waslaati</em>. They relate that this
part was at one time inhabited by a
very wicked people, and that the
Pharaoh under whom the Israelites
were in bondage, and who received
such signal chastisement, was a native
of these mountains. The Mohammedan
doctors go still further,
and assert that it was upon this Gebel
Waslaat that Eblis (Satan) was hurled
down, after his expulsion from the regions
of light and happiness; and
that it was in these mountains that
he took up his first earthly abode.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving these ill-omened mountains
to the west, they journeyed south-eastwards,
for two days, through a
plain, which, says Mr Davis, “for
this part of the world, must be pronounced
a luxuriant one.” It is
pretty well cultivated, and is watered
by a river which has its source in the
Waslaat mountains. They then encamped
for a couple of days in the vicinity
of Cairwan, the “city of saints.”
“At a short distance,” he says, “this,
like every other Mohammedan city of
any note, has a fine appearance, but
as one approaches, its beauty vanishes.
Crooked and filthy streets, ruined and
dilapidated houses, wretched shops
and miserable hovels, are too glaring
not to attract one’s attention.” The
city is surrounded by a wall in pretty
good condition, and has a garrison of
regular as well as of irregular troops.
Outside are large cisterns, supplementing
the reservoirs with which
the houses within are furnished for
collecting rain-water; and, still more
remarkable, though much less useful,
the tomb wherein repose the holy remains
of Saint <em>Shaab</em>, “the Prophet’s
barber.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After a two days’ halt, they left behind
them the plain of Cairwan, and
began to approach the borders of the
Sahara. On the day after starting,
the Prince’s party was met by the
“noble and highly-favoured” tribe of
Arabs, the Dreeds (who are allowed
to sit in presence of a prince, whilst
every other Arab is obliged to stand),
headed by their <em>kaid</em> or governor,
Smeeda Ben Azooz. “Smeeda himself
was mounted on a magnificent
grey steed, whose saddle appeared to
be of a solid mass of gold, so richly
was it embroidered; and the other
trappings were also sumptuously
adorned with gold and silver. He
rode in advance, and the hundred
Dreeds who followed him were on
horses not much inferior to that of
their proud and haughty chief. When
within about a hundred yards of the
Prince, Smeeda dismounted, and approached
on foot to kiss his hand.
On resuming his seat in the saddle, he
took up his position to his master’s
left, whilst his attendants fell back in
the rear of our party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Prince was enthusiastically
fond of hunting. Every day, when
he had the opportunity, he was engaged
in it. The chase of gazelles
was his favourite sport, and it was
one in which success was neither
easily nor frequently achieved. “It
is a grand sight,” says Mr Davis,
“to behold these slender-limbed and
feeble-looking tiny creatures defying
the most spirited horse in speed.
When pursued, they actually often
stopped to nibble the grass,—as if to
challenge the rider and ridicule his
efforts, and treat him, his horse and
hounds alike, with contempt.” They
were frequently seen in companies of
about twenty together. On the day
after Smeeda and his Dreeds joined
the expedition, a great many gazelles
were chased by the Prince’s cavalry
and the Arabs, but not a single one
was killed. This, it is alleged, was
owing, firstly, to the rough and broken
character of the soil; secondly, to
the burning heat which prevailed;
and thirdly, the shirocco wind, which
sometimes, as it blew in their faces,
seemed as if it carried along with it
flames of fire, and caused the riders to
check the speed of their horses. But
to compensate the party for their
bootless efforts, Smeeda sent his servants
for his well-trained hawks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In half an hour about twenty of these
birds of prey, of an unusually large size,
were brought, accompanied by several
Dreeds, expert in hawking. Smeeda,—who
is rather a short, but very corpulent
man, with a handsome face, ornamented
by a fine black, neatly-trimmed beard,
and most penetrating dark eyes,—was
this day mounted on a beautiful white
horse, decked out with the same saddle
and trappings his grey horse exhibited
the day before. The dress of the rider
was elegant and rich in the extreme.
As soon as he had protected his hands
from the talons by gauntlets, partly
covered with plates of gold, a hawk was
handed to him by one of his attendants.
He undid the hood which confined the
head of the bird, and prevented his quick
eye from beholding the objects around.
In an instant the hawk was seen soaring
up to the sky. Another and another followed,
and in this manner about twelve or
fifteen were despatched. A few seconds
elapsed, when one after the other pounced
upon his prey. Hares and rabbits, partridges
and other birds, were thus secured
in abundance. The servants were busily
engaged running in all directions to secure
both the hawks and the prey,—the former,
in order to adjust their hoods for a short
time previous to being despatched again;
and the latter, ‘to cut the throat’ before
life is extinct, so as to render them lawful
food for the <em>true believer</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In connection with this love of the
chase, we must mention an incident
which occurred as the expedition
was approaching Cairwan, and which
shows how little prevalent is any rule
but the “law of the strongest” in
those quarters, and how naturally
men take to deceit as a refuge against
lawless force. Mr Davis and some
others of the party came to half-a-dozen
Arab tents, where, to their
great surprise, a general stillness and
gloom prevailed. The men and children
sat on the ground with an air of
profoundest melancholy; whilst the
women, usually so active, were resting
from their labours, and exhibiting
grief by floods of tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘What has happened, Ali, that you
are all so much cast down?’ asked one
of our party, addressing an old man.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘Such is the will of God,’ was the only
reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘But what has happened, Ali?’</p>

<p class='c012'>‘<em>Maktoob</em>,—it is so preordained!’
answered the old man, shaking his head,
and clasping his hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘Has any one died?’</p>

<p class='c012'>To this he only replied with a sigh, and
pointed us to the interior of his tent.
But instead of participating in his grief,
my friend abruptly asked him,—Where is
the <i><span lang="it">sloghi</span></i> (greyhound) of last year?’</p>

<p class='c012'>‘How can you put such a question to
me, when you witness my grief and distress?’</p>

<p class='c012'>‘Who, then, is dead?’ pursued my inquisitive
companion.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘My wife!’ replied the old Arab, again
pointing us to the interior of the tent,
where apparently she lay, covered with
a kind of blanket.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘But what have you done with <em>the
lovely</em> (greyhound)?’</p>

<p class='c012'>Old Ali now indignantly expressed his
surprise that such a question should be
put to him at a time when his mind
was so differently occupied. He thought
it manifested hard-heartedness, if not
cruelty.</p>

<p class='c012'>‘But are you sure your wife is <em>quite</em>
dead?’</p>

<p class='c012'>‘Do not mock me, O Moslems!’</p>

<p class='c012'>The interrogator then called a soldier,
who happened to be near, and gave him
his horse to hold, while he himself ruthlessly
entered the tent. On removing the
blanket, he found the Arab’s wife, all alive,
and holding the pet <i><span lang="it">sloghi</span></i> in her arms.
On being thus detected, the poor woman
cried out most beseechingly, ‘Do not
take the dog!’ and the whole company,
men, women, and children, most imploringly
re-echoed the cry.</p>

<p class='c012'>The intruder then turned to old Ali,
and with an ironical smile said,—‘You
see your <em>dear</em> wife is not <em>quite</em> dead!’”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Prince, as we have said, was a
keen sportsman, and not one of his
dogs could compare with Ali’s <i><span lang="it">sloghi</span></i>;
but his veneration for justice predominated
even over his love of the chase.
“Ali is rich,” said he, when the
hound was brought to him, “and
money will not tempt him, else I
would gladly offer it him. Send the
<i><span lang="it">sloghi</span></i> instantly back!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The day after the junction of Smeeda
and his noble Dreeds, the expedition
entered the district of the Majer,—a
tribe (numbering 200 tents, or
1200 souls) of a peculiarly rascally character,
and the larger portion of whose
scanty resources is obtained by the
robbery and murder of travellers. For
these outrages they are rarely brought
to account, save when the Prince, or
other representative of the Regency of
Tunis, makes a tour in person among
the tribes. On the present occasion
they had a heavy debt to pay,—the
value of a life, in the Desert, being
generally reckoned at from twenty-five
to thirty camels. Within the
precincts of this tribe are the ruins of
Spaitla, the ancient Sufetula; and, by
the favour of the Prince, our author
set out to visit them. Under the
guidance of the Majer chief, and escorted
by twenty soldiers well mounted,
and armed to the teeth—after a gallop
over a beautiful plain, and thence
crossing a district of hill and dale,
“all covered with verdure, and occasionally
bordering upon the picturesque,”
Mr Davis and his party arrived
at the ruins. On their first approach all
was perfectly still. Not a sound but
their own was audible, save the rippling
of a brook which glides past the
ruins on their north-eastern side. Not
a human being was to be seen, either
among the ruins or in their vicinity;
and even animal life seemed to have
for ever departed from the sombre
walls and mansions of the ancient Sufetulans.
But such was not really the
case. In the holes, caverns, and clefts
of the rocks on which the city stands,
were dispersed numbers of the followers
and subjects of the Majer chief.
From their dwellings they issued forth
imperceptibly to the travellers. And
most unpleasant company they must
have been; for, says our author, “all
the corrupt ramifications of the human
heart,—all the vile actions of
which man is capable, could be traced,
and that distinctly, in the features of
these sons of Ghiath.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The situation of this ancient city is
delightful. It is built upon an eminence,
commanding a panoramic view
of an expanse of country which, even
in its present barren and deserted condition,
has a charming aspect. Wild
olive, juniper, and almond trees in
abundance stud the banks of the
brook. Of the place itself, Mr Davis
says, “I had no conception of the extent
of the ruins to be found here; so
that my companions, as well as myself,
were absolutely amazed on beholding
the magnificence of some of
them. As I viewed these from some
angles, I could almost fancy myself
again on the majestic ruins of Baalbec.”
He especially notices a sumptuous
triumphal arch of the Corinthian
order, with a lesser arch on each
side. From this he proceeded to three
temples,—upon which time, and the
innate destructive disposition of the
Arabs, have left evident traces.
“Parts are in a most dilapidated condition,
yet it is surprising to meet
with so much which, with very little
trouble and expense, might easily be
restored to its former grandeur. The
front and entrance to the temples are
in ruins, and large masses of stone are
lying about in all directions, and block
up the ingress; but the backs, which
face the triumphal arch, are in capital
repair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On his return from visiting the
ruins of Spaitla, our author and his
companions, miscalculating the movements
of the main body of the expedition,
found themselves very much
out of their reckoning. Night came
on,—their guide, the Majer chief, disappeared
at the very time his presence
was most required; and what with
the fear of his rascally tribe before
their eyes, as well as of the wild
beasts of the desert, the night which
the little party had to pass on the
sands before they could rejoin the
main body was anything but a comfortable
one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lions are common in these parts,
and their tracks were occasionally
visible; but the king of beasts
nowhere appeared in person, and
the Prince, who longed to try his
skill on this lordly tenant of the wastes,
was balked of his sport. Hyenas are
likewise to be met with; and the manner
in which they are taken by the
Arabs in these parts is very peculiar.
Its subterranean abode, it appears, is
so narrow as not to permit of the animal
turning about in it; and hence,
to use the Arab phraseology, it has
“two doors,” by one of which it enters,
and by the other goes out. The
Arabs, lying <i><span lang="fr">perdus</span></i> in the vicinity of
one of these dens, watch the particular
hole by which the hyena enters, and
then proceed to place a strong rope
net over the opposite hole,—whilst
one of their fraternity, skilled in the
business, and prepared with a rope,
works his way in by “the door” which
the animal has entered. As he nears
the brute (which cannot turn upon
him), he “charms it,” according to
our author’s informants, saying,—“Come,
my dear little creature; I
will lead you to places where many
carcases are prepared for you,—plenty
of food awaits you. Let me fasten
this rope to your beautiful leg, and
stand quiet whilst I do so.” This sentence,
or something very similar to it,
is repeated till the operation is effectually
achieved; when the daring son
of the Sahara begins to gore the brute
with a dagger, till he is forced to rush
out, when he is caught in the net, and
either killed on the spot or carried off
alive. If any blunder happens, however,—as
is sometimes the case—through
which the hyena is enabled
to struggle and re-enter its abode, the
“charmer,” in spite of his charming,
falls a victim to its savage rage, and
frequently his companions can scarcely
contrive to get clear without feeling
something of its effects.</p>

<p class='c009'>The powerful Hamama tribe was
the next which our travellers fell in
with,—two hundred of this tribe coming
to pay their respects to the heir-apparent
of the throne, and escort him
to the city of Cafsa. “There was
much in their appearance,” says Mr
Davis, “to make me regard this tribe
with a great degree of interest. They
are genuine Arabs, and of this they
are very proud. ‘Their hand is
against every man, and every man’s
hand is against them.’ An officer
from the reigning sovereign of Tunis,
(who has just joined our expedition)
with a number of cavalry soldiers, is
now amongst them, in order to enforce
a fine of 2000 camels, for murders
and other outrages committed by these
genuine descendants of Ishmael. They
are at enmity with the Dreeds, jealous
of the Farasheesh, and almost
constantly at war with the Mamshe—a
tribe inhabiting the western borders
of the regency, quite as powerful and
as full of pretensions as their own.”
As seldom more than thirty camels
are ever demanded for a single life,
these two thousand camels symbolise
upwards of sixty murders committed
by this tribe, and known to the Government!</p>

<p class='c009'>His Highness the Prince made his
entry in grand style into Cafsa,—the
Mamlooks on their choice horses, and
in their best uniforms—a native band
playing their national tunes—a host
of unfurled banners—and at the wings
several companies of cavalry. In all,
including the various tribes that had
joined, the camp now amounted to no
less than 30,000 men, about 50,000
camels, and 2000 horses and mules!
“A just estimate of the size of the
expedition,” says our author, “can
only be formed by viewing it from
some eminence as it is moving along,
either in some large plain, or over the
seas of sand which now and then it is
traversing. Often have I taken my
position on a little hillock, and could
see nothing for miles before me or behind
but the living masses which composed
the inhabitants of our canvass
city. How similar to this must have
been the marching of the Children of
Israel in the wilderness, on their way
from Egypt to the Promised Land!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The morning was lovely as they
approached Cafsa. Not a speck could
be discovered in the sky, and everything
around seemed to have an aspect
of contentment and cheerfulness.
The city is surrounded by gardens,
gay with clusters of date, olive, lemon,
orange, pomegranate, pistacchio, and
other fruit trees. “In walking among
these gardens, richly watered by a delicious
brook, which has its supply from
two fountains, one within the citadel,
and the other in the centre of the city,
a stranger can imagine himself in
some more temperate region, and
among a people more advanced in
civilisation.” But on entering the
city, the charm (as usual) vanishes.
Cafsa is the ancient Capsa, (built
three hundred years before Carthage),
the stronghold of Jugurtha; of the
inhabitants of which place Florus says,
“They are in the midst of their sands
and serpents, which defend them better
from those that would attack them
than armies and ramparts would.”
Marius, however, after some adroit
manœuvring, pounced upon and took
the city;—and as the inhabitants were
strongly attached to the Numidian
prince, the Roman general, after giving
the place up to be plundered by his
soldiers, levelled it with the ground,
and put the inhabitants to the sword,
or sold them as slaves. The modern
city, built on the ruins of the ancient
one, is situated upon a rising ground,
and has a population of about three
or four thousand inhabitants. Within
it there is a spring, the waters of
which, at their source, are tepid, but
are considerably cooled in the large
basin into which they discharge themselves.
This is in all probability the
<em>Tarmid</em> of Edrisi and the <i><span lang="la">Jugis aqua</span></i>
of Sallust. A small kind of fish, about
two or three inches in length, is to be
found in this slightly tepid basin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The capture of one of the Hamana
tribe at this place, who had been
“preaching up a kind of crusade
against the Government, and instilling
Chartist principles,” (!) not unnaturally
suggests to Mr Davis the recollection
of certain cases of capital punishment
which he had witnessed at Tunis.
One of these he thus describes:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“A crowd near the Carthagenian gate
attracted my attention, and on inquiry
I found that the five or six hundred persons
had assembled to see the sentence of
their despot carried into execution. In a
few minutes six <em>hambas</em> (policemen) made
their appearance on the wall, some forty
yards distant from the gate, and about
thirty feet in height, leading two culprits,
whose hands were pinioned in front. They
stepped firmly, and seemed quite callous
and indifferent about their doom. The
hambas set at once about their work.
They fastened ropes round the necks of
the criminals, which they secured to the
battlements, on the wall. No ecclesiastic
was present to administer any religious
consolation; but the executioners now
and then ejaculated the words, <em>Maktoob</em>,
‘it is so predestinated,’ and <em>Hacka yehab
rubby</em>, ‘such is the will of God.’ When
desired to take the position pointed out
to them, they did so without manifesting
the slightest reluctance, or exhibiting the
least symptom of fear. Each took his
seat between two of the battlements, their
feet hanging over. They looked for a
moment on the crowd beneath; and when
one of the hambas desired them to pronounce
their creed, they cried out, ‘O
Moslems! pray for us.’ Then, turning
their eyes heavenwards, they pronounced
in a clear, distinct, and audible voice, the
words,’There is no God but God, and
Mohammed is his apostle.’ When the
last word was uttered, the executioners
pushed them simultaneously off the wall,
and thus the wretched men were launched
into eternity. The conduct of the assembled
spectators was very orderly—indeed,
grief seemed depicted on every
countenance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In Mohammedan law, sentences,
whether capital or otherwise, are no
sooner pronounced than they are carried
into execution. There is a delectable
variety in the modes of exit from
this world, which the law prescribes
for capital offenders. Arabs are generally
hanged, seldom decapitated;
Turks are mostly strangled; Jews
are dealt with after the manner of
Arabs. Women are drowned; and
the higher classes, and princes, enjoy
the privilege of being poisoned. In
some few cases, criminals are sentenced
to be burned. One mode of
death—which we Europeans regard
as rather an honourable one—is regarded
by the Koran-readers and the
orthodox portion of the community as
heterodox in the extreme. A knowledge
of Roger Bacon’s invention,
gunpowder, never having been vouchsafed
to the Prophet in any of his
revelations, the Faithful, of course, are
unable to find a single passage in the
Koran to justify sentencing a soldier
to be shot. But in this, as in many
other instances, the common sense or
convenience of the Pasha leads him
to deviate from the Cadi’s opinion,
and to overrule the <em>Sharrah</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>On leaving Cafsa, our travellers
found themselves fairly in the Sahara.
“As the day advanced,” says Mr Davis,
“the heat increased, and by noon became
almost intolerable. Besides the
excessive heat of a burning sun, we
had to endure the noxious influence
of the southerly wind, which, fortunately
for us, did not blow with all
its wonted fury. Its effect, however,
was apparent, not only on myself,
but also on some of my friends. The
weakness and lassitude these combined
agencies produced, manifested
themselves by the perfect stillness
and sullenness which prevailed in
every group of travellers, as they
either walked or rode along. The
heat it collected in its sweep across
the burning sands, it now freely vented
on us,—and that to such a degree that
some of its puffs actually resembled
in their effects the flames issuing from
a furnace.” No wonder that the
Psylli of old should have attempted
the extermination of so destructive
a tenant of the waste! This nation,
says Herodotus, who in ancient
times inhabited a district bordering
on the <em>Regio Syrtica</em>, having once had
all their reservoirs of water dried
up by the south wind, advanced into
the Sahara in order to make war
upon it; but the enemy, defying bow
and arrow, opposed them by blowing
with extreme violence, and raised
such clouds and torrents of sand that
the poor Psylli were overwhelmed,
and all of them perished! What African
traveller does not regret that the
victory was on the side of the noxious
element!</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Davis never saw the Simoom in
its full and dreadful force, nor did he
witness any of those astounding exhibitions
of sand-columns, circling in
numbers over the surface of the desert,
and overwhelming everything that
come in their way, that Bruce once
gazed upon with awe and wonder.
But of snakes and scorpions, and suchlike
poisonous inhabiters of the Desert,
our author had his fill. On one occasion,
when about to encamp, they
found the ground literally covered with
snakes, whose bite, the Arabs say, is
certain death. “Happily for man,”
said one of Mr Davis’s companions,
“these reptiles have not the benefit
of sight;—had they not been deficient
in this, the world could not have existed,
as these enemies of man would
undoubtedly have extirpated him
from the face of the earth! So
powerful is their sting, that they have
been known to have penetrated the
large iron stirrup of the Hamama.”
The snake thus alluded to—and we
need hardly say, our readers may
take the description <i><span lang="la">cum grano salis</span></i>—is
the <em>liffa</em> or <em>liffach</em>,—a reptile about
a yard in length; and the account
which the Arabs give of the death of
those who have been bitten by it
tallies very closely with the description
which Lucan gives of the death of
Nasidius in the same locality:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A fate of different kind Nasidius found:</div>
      <div class='line'>A burning <i><span lang="fr">prester</span></i> gave the deadly wound,—</div>
      <div class='line'>And straight a sudden flame began to spread,</div>
      <div class='line'>And paint his visage with a glowing red.</div>
      <div class='line'>With swift expansion swells the bloated skin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nought but an undistinguish’d mass is seen:</div>
      <div class='line'>The puffy poison spreads and heaves around,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till all the man is in the monster drown’d.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The next place the expedition reached
was Tozar,—a town fairly in the
Sahara, and beyond even the farreaching
sway of the old <i><span lang="la">Dominos rerum</span></i>
and their redoubtable Legionaries.
“Before Tozar,” says our author,
“there are a few hillocks, dotted with
some majestic palm-trees; affording
a delightful shade: and the silvery
rivulet, winding its way among these
in devious directions, adds to the
charm of the scene. As we approached,
we found the hillocks and the trees
literally covered with men, women,
and children,—assembled to witness
the entry of Prince Mohammed and
the camp, with their shrill notes of
<em>lo-lo-lo-lo</em>!” Tozar, like the other
cities of the Sahara, is in one important
feature different from those on
the coast. Generally speaking, the
streets of all the towns of Barbary,
like those in Egypt and Syria, are exceedingly
narrow, so that one camel,
laden with wood or merchandise, is
sufficient to obstruct the thoroughfare.
But in the towns of the Sahara the
streets are generally very wide,—the
object of which is, to allow the furious
winds of the Desert, charged with immense
masses of sand, to sweep clean
through, instead of being checked in
their course, and therefore blocking
up the streets with their noxious deposit.
From these sand-storms of
the desert, the coast-towns have little
to fear, on account of the intervening
mountain-chains robbing those terrible
visitants of their deadly burden; and
accordingly the inhabitants of the
Barbary towns can afford to build
their streets very narrow, so as to exclude
the fierce rays of the sun,—a
luxury which their southern brethren
dare not indulge in.</p>

<p class='c009'>The population of Tozar amounts
to about five thousand,—for the most
part of a swarthy complexion, with a
cast of features bordering upon that
of the Negro. Indeed every fresh
stage one makes in the journey into
Central Africa, a gradual change is
perceptible in the features and complexion
of the population,—the white
man, by a slow but invariable process,
changing into a Negro. “Were it
possible,” says Mr Davis, “to introduce
into Europe an ethnological collection,
classified latitudinally, from
the northern coast to Central Africa,
the greatest sceptic might be convinced
of the fact, that <em>time</em> and <em>place</em>
alone made our coloured fellow-creatures
what they are. The slave-dealer,
and the Negro-dealer, might
thus have an ocular demonstration of
the great truth, that the black man is
our brother, and that circumstances
alone, with the nature of which we
are not fully acquainted, made him
to differ from us.” He mentions,
as an additional proof of this, that
even among the Jews (who, he says,
“have probably lived in this part of
Africa from the time the Phœnicians
first settled here”) a striking difference
is perceptible between those
on the coast and those residing
in the interior. He adds the curious
fact, that in the desert the
Jews certainly do not live for many
centuries; and thence deduces the
conclusion, that if its influence is
so clearly shown in them, both as regards
colour and features, it is not to
be wondered that it should have told
to a much greater extent on those to
whom the Sahara has been a home
for thousands of years. Of all these
vari-coloured sections of the North
African population, the most merry
and gay are unquestionably the Negroes,
whether male or female. To
ask a Moor or an Arab if he danced,
would be to offer him a serious insult—the
former especially being too
grave to have a regard even for music.
But the black people are almost always
cheerful, and enjoy life even
when in a state of bondage. “Often
have I seen them,” says Mr Davis,
“congregated by hundreds in some
open space, singing and dancing, and
playing, for hours consecutively. The
ability of the Negro to accommodate
himself to circumstances is surprising.
What would depress and crush a
white man is supported with a marvellous
resignation by the black,
whose light heart enables him to toil
and to sing, to suffer, and yet not despair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Within the oasis of Tozar, and its
date-forest, are half-a-dozen villages,
besides four marabouts with their cupolas,
around each of which are a few
huts. The houses of the Desert are
generally only one storey high, and are
built, like those of Cafsa, of bricks,
with rafters of palm-wood. The interior
of the houses is as humble as
their exterior. The rooms are long and
narrow, with only a hole here and
there to admit the light; and from the
rafters of the ceiling of every apartment
is suspended the stock of dates
which, with milk, forms the principal
articles alike of food and of commerce.
It is by the sale, or rather barter, of
their dates to the wandering tribes that
the inhabitants of the oasis of Tozar
procure for themselves wheat, barley,
cloth, cattle, &#38;c. In former times
their commerce was not of so simple
or so innocent description—for a flourishing
business used to be done here
with Tunis in human flesh. A slave
was given in exchange for two or
three hundredweight of dates, or at
the intrinsic value of about £3; and
when the rich planter’s shed was filled,
he marched the unhappy objects
of his purchase northwards to the
coast, where they were shipped for
their various destinations. “Before
the abolition of slavery in the regency
of Tunis,” says our author, “I have
often seen caravans from this place
exposing their merchandise in the
slave-market of the capital, and selling
them at the rate of £12 or £15
per head. But this lucrative business
is now stopped, at least so far as
Tunis is concerned, and loud are the
complaints of the Tozarians on this
subject.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides the stock of dates pendant
from the ceiling, the chief ornaments
which decorate the rooms of the Sahara
towns, are a strange medley of
jars, jugs, dishes, plates, bottles, and
glasses, suspended on the wall facing
the entrance-door. Here they are
exhibited promiscuously, totally irrespective
of size, shape, colour, or order,
and by the quantity of these, an
estimate is formed of the wealth of the
owner. A low table, a few stools
made of the branches of the palm-tree,
and, in some instances, a couch
or divan, complete the furniture of an
apartment,—and an apartment generally
forms the residence of a single
family. At night, sheepskins, rugs,
or mats, are spread on the floor, and
supply the place of beds. Every
household, we may add, has one or
more immense jars, into which any
loose or stray dates are thrown.
Within an inch or two of the bottom
of these jars there is a top, by which
they draw off a species of date-honey,
which they use in cooking and for
other purposes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Date-honey, however, is not the
only species of juice which the Tozarians
obtain from the palm-trees of their
oasis; for we are informed that though
the devout believers in the Koran there
scrupulously abstain from <em>wine</em>, they
indulge freely in <em>lagmi</em>, or the juice of
the palm-tree, which, when fermented,
is quite as intoxicating in its effects
as the beverage prohibited by the
Prophet. This juice is easily obtained,
and if possible still more easily
prepared. At a certain season of the
year, an incision is made in the tree
just beneath the branches,—a jar is
then so fastened as to receive the
liquid as it exudes,—and, in this
manner, they usually procure from a
tree, during the course of a night, from
a quart to a quart and a half of <em>lagmi</em>.
When drunk immediately, this liquor
tastes like genuine rich milk, and is
perfectly free from an intoxicating influence;
but when allowed to stand
for a night, or at most for twenty-four
hours—during which time fermentation
takes place—“it partakes (with
the exception of the colour, which is
whitish) of the quality and flavour of
champagne, and that of a much superior
sort to what is usually offered in the
British markets.” This date-tree wine
is to be found in every house, and has
its victims reeling through the streets
of Tozar just as beer and whisky have
in our streets at home. But the curious
part of the matter is, that “the
faithful” openly justify themselves
against the charge of transgressing
their Prophet’s precept. “<em>Lagmi</em> is
not wine,” they say, “and the Prophet’s
prohibition refers to <em>wine</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the social relations at Tozar, Mr
Davis says:—“My first impression,
on visiting several families, was such
as to induce me to believe that greater
domestic happiness prevailed here
than in the Mohammedan cities on the
coast. The females are not kept in
distinct and separate apartments, nor
do they even cover their faces when
in the presence of strangers, but appear
perfectly free, and seem exceedingly
affable.” A closer examination,
however, sufficed to show that the
regulations of Mohammedanism in regard
to females produced very much
the same results here as elsewhere.
Marriage is usually contracted very
early,—so that it is no uncommon thing
to see boys of thirteen and fourteen in
possession of wives of eleven or twelve,
or even younger; and the result, here
as elsewhere, is, that girls of twelve
look as old as European females do at
twenty, and at thirty they are almost fit
to be placed on the retired list. Indeed,
as Colonel Dow in his <cite>Ferishta</cite> says,
polygamy in the East is founded very
much on natural causes, as, owing to
early marriages, and the effects of the
climate, a man there keeps his vigour
long enough to see two or three wives
bloom and fade in succession. Moslems
consider it wrong, and even sinful,
if a man has reached his twentieth
year without marrying. The young
couple are joined together on the
good faith of their parents or relations;
for they are not permitted to
see each other before the nuptial night.
Certain persons, however,—generally
old women, relatives of the parties—are
sent from the man, who examine
the lady, and bring him back a report
of her bodily accomplishments. If the
man finds himself disappointed, he has
a right to send her back to her parents,
without restoring to her the portion
that was promised her,—or rather,
the price that was to be paid for her,
as the wife is bought by the husband.
The young damsels, it must be allowed,
take all pains to avoid so lamentable
a catastrophe. “Excessive
obesity,” says Mr Davis, “is considered
the perfection of female beauty
among the Mohammedans on the
coast; hence a young woman, after
she is betrothed, receives gold or silver
shackles upon her hands and wrists,
and is fed so long till these are filled
up. A kind of seed called <em>drough</em>,
and their national dish <em>coscoso</em>, are
used for the purpose. The young lady
is literally crammed, and some actually
die under the spoon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These African beauties, it would appear,
are subject to strange fantasies
and superstitions. The Jenoon, or
devil, we are told, sometimes causes a
lady to fancy some article of dress or
jewellery; and until her husband (for
the lady is always a married one) procures
her the article, the Jenoon torments
her in a most pitiless manner.
But the tormentor is not satisfied
by the lady obtaining the article.
He must have something for himself,
in return for the trouble he takes in
the matter,—and that something is
nothing less than a splendid feast exclusively
of ladies. Our reverend author,
however, by special favour, was
once present at a feast of this kind at
Nabil, the ancient Neapolis; and as
the spirits do not seem to have stood
much in awe of “the cloth,” he is
able to furnish us with the following
account of this Jenoon or devil
feast:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The room in which it was celebrated
was beautifully illuminated, and surrounded
with ottomans, upon which the ladies,
amounting to forty, were luxuriously reclining,
and amongst them the lady possessed
by the Jenoon. All of them were
beautifully dressed, and none of them,
judging from their appearance, were more
than forty years of age, though some of
them were still in their teens. After I
had been there a few moments, supper
was brought in; and coscoso, the favourite
dish of Barbary, was of course not excluded.
They all sat down on the ground,
and some with wooden spoons, whilst
others with their hands, partook freely of
the repast. I was invited to join them,
which I did, and had also the pleasure to
be favoured with a spoon.” (We hope it
was a <em>long</em> one!)</p>

<p class='c012'>“After supper they all took their former
places; and a band of music began
to strike up some of their national tunes.
All the ladies sat quiet—till of a sudden
one of them, a young woman of about
twenty, arose and began to dance by herself.
She was soon followed by several
others, who were wheeling rapidly round;
and all of them worked themselves into
such a frenzy that from weakness they
dropped to the ground, where they lay,
till, recovering their strength, they recommenced
their madness. This lasted
a considerable time. The lady with the
Jenoon was sitting quietly on the ottoman.
When the visitors had finished their
amusement, she started up, and followed
their example; and when she, like the
others, was stretched on the floor, one of
the spectators arose, and asked what
article she fancied,—to which she made
no reply. The former then named several
articles of dress, asking whether she
wished any of them; and when the article
which the Jenoon lady desired was mentioned,
(I believe a shawl), she suddenly
started up,—and this was the signal that
the Jenoon feast was considered as ended.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Barbary ladies play the <em>Jenoon</em>
with their husbands at this rate,
it is not to be wondered at that a separation
from such fantastic spirits
should be placed within easy reach of
the man. Barbary husbands, at least
if they be Moslems, can take back their
divorced partners after a first divorce,
but not after a second, unless—strange
provision!—she has in the interim
been married to another man. A husband
may oblige his divorced wife to
nurse any infant she has borne him,
until it is two years old; and no man
can marry a divorced woman sooner
than four months and a half after her
total separation from the former husband.
The facility with which a divorce
can be procured in Northern
Africa, even for the most trivial causes,
cannot be otherwise than most pernicious
to the social welfare of the community.
Mr Davis narrates the following
anecdote in illustration of this
ridiculous as well as most mischievous
license:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“A servant of mine of the name of
Ali, once very pressingly applied for leave
to go out for a short time. It was not my
custom to inquire into the nature of his
business, but, on that occasion something
unaccountable prompted me to put the
question,—‘And where are you going to,
Ali?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Holding up a piece of paper, he very
coolly answered,—‘To give my wife this
divorce; and shall soon be back, <em>Arfi</em>,’
(my master).</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘To give your wife a divorce! Well,
you may go; but remember, if you divorce
her, I from this very moment divorce
you.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Handing me the paper, Ali exclaimed,—‘Here,
master, take it; on such conditions
I shall not divorce my wife.”’</p>

<p class='c008'>Tozar was the most southerly point
which the expedition reached; and
here it remained for the space of three
weeks, during which time Mr Davis
and his three French companions
made excursions to the neighbouring
oases. Accompanied by the Governor
and Cadi of Nefta, with a retinue of
some twenty well-mounted servants,
they set out over the sands to visit that
place. “Never,” says Mr Davis, “had
the propriety of styling the camel <em>the
ship of the Desert</em> been so apparent to
me as this day. The whole way from
Tozar to Nefta, the Desert had completely
the aspect of a vast bed of an
ocean, and we seemed to plough the
sandy waves of the Sahara as the ship
does those of the sea. The morning
was rather hazy, and the sky was
overcast with a number of detached
small white clouds, which (particularly
those along the horizon) very
often assumed the form of a variety
of sailing crafts; and thus added considerably
to the delusion, under the
influence of which we Europeans were
quite willing to abide, viz. of navigating
some expansive lake. By seven
o’clock, however, the sun burst forth
in all his brilliance; every cloud was
speedily dispersed, and a clear, blue
ethereal sky was stretched over us as
far as the eye could reach.” When
fairly launched upon the Deserts, the
sameness of the scenery becomes most
oppressive. Seldom is the traveller’s
eye refreshed by anything in the shape
of a mountain or a green plain. One
sea of sand succeeds another; and
were it not for an occasional mirage,
which for a time diverts them, or, for
the circumstance that the glaring sun
and drifting sand-clouds compels them
sometimes for hours together to envelop
their faces in the <em>bornoos</em>, or
cloak, so that they are able to dream
of the fantastic groups of date-trees,
and the gentle rivulets winding
amongst them in their native land,
their journey through such portions
of the Desert would be the most intolerable
and dreary imaginable.
These alleviations, or “comforts,” as
an old voyager of the Desert called
them, being mere illusions, are rather
calculated to vex the heart of the inexperienced
traveller. But those who
have been in the habit of crossing the
sandy ocean from their infancy, and
to whom every spot on its surface is
familiar, are diverted, and even cheered
by such illusions. “It is a change
for them,” said one of these veteran
voyagers, “and any change in a monotonous
life is agreeable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On the present occasion, however,
our travellers were embarked on a
much shorter journey. A few hours’
ride sufficed to carry them over the
waste, and bring them to the oasis of
Nefta—of the extreme antiquity of
which town the Cadi had the most
assured belief. “Nefta,” said he,
“was built—or, rather the foundation
of it was laid—by <em>Saidna Noah</em> (our
Lord Noah): peace be upon him!
Here he discovered the first dry spot;
and hence he disembarked here, and
erected an abode for his family.”
The inhabitants of these oases of the
Desert are not without their etiquette;
and on approaching the town,
the Governor assumed his dignified
aspect, made his entry with all possible
gravity, and was no sooner seated
in his own residence than the sheikhs
and aristocracy of Nefta assembled
to welcome him, some kissing his
head, some his shoulder, some his elbow,
and some the palm of his hand.
The worthy Governor, however, who
had a good dash of humour in his
composition, loved other things better
than etiquette. “No sooner was
the assembly dismissed,” says our
author, “than our lordly host again
resumed his easy and affable manner.
When the sound of the feet of the last
grandee had died away, Ibrahim rose
up, and assumed an attitude which
might have been a subject for the
study of an artist. There he stood,
not unlike what I could fancy a Demosthenes,
a Cato, or a Cicero, when
on the point of commencing one of
their thrilling orations. Ibrahim remained
in that position a few seconds,
and then turning to us, said, ‘I am
glad to be free again. Gentlemen!
you no doubt are hungry as well as
myself; have you any objection to a
good dinner?’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Having despatched the dinner, which
justified the host’s eulogium of it, and
reposed for a few hours after their fatigues,
Mr Davis and one of his companions
set out by themselves to ride
all round the oasis of Nefta. “All
went on well at first,” he says, “and we
even enjoyed our ride along the outskirts
of the thick forest of magnificent
and majestic date-trees, till we suddenly
perceived our horses sinking beneath
us. ‘Pull up! pull up!’ screamed my
companion; ‘the ground is unsafe!’
We were on the brink of getting on the
<em>Kilta</em>, a dangerous swamp, which receives
the surplus waters of the head-fountain,
after they have supplied the
vast date-plantations. The <em>Kilta</em> joins
the ‘Sea of Pharaoh,’ and never have
I seen anything of a more delusive
character. The surface of the swamp
had precisely the same appearance as
the solid ground; and had we been
riding at full speed, we might have
perished in this deceitful abyss.” The
<em>Ras Elain</em>—“head fountain or spring,”—which
is the source of the <i><span lang="nl">waad</span></i>, or
river, constitutes the charm and luxury
of this delightful oasis. The
spring is surrounded on three sides
by hillocks, and is embowered amidst
a cluster of palm-trees, so thickly and
eccentrically placed that our travellers
had much difficulty in approaching
it so as to taste its waters. <em>Fi
kol donya ma atsh’ kaifho’</em>,—“In the
whole world there is nothing like it!”
exclaimed their guide. “And I must
candidly confess,” says Mr Davis,
“that though he had never left the
locality of his birth, he was pretty
correct on this point. Never did I
taste more delicious water; and we
unanimously agreed that the Neftaweens
might well be proud of their
<em>Ras Elain</em>. What a boon is this
spring, located as it is amidst the
burning sands!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the great marvel of this district
is the mysterious <em>Bakar Faraoon</em>,
the “Sea of Pharaoh.” The
whole tribes of the vicinity look with
awe and terror upon this so-called
“sea,” and superstitions innumerable
are connected with it. Not only has
the army of that wicked monarch after
whom the sea is called, perished in it,
but hosts of infidel sovereigns, persecutors
of the Faithful, with their myriads
of warriors, been engulfed in it, and
are still sinking down its bottomless
abyss! Such are the reports of the Moslems,
confirmed by the weighty asseverations
of our author’s learned friend,
the Cadi of Nefta. “Not only have
numberless armies been seen marching
and re-marching on its surface by
night,” said that erudite expounder of
the Koran, “but repeatedly have
they been seen during broad daylight.
Giants on monstrously large horses,
have been seen galloping about in
various directions, advancing and receding,
and then suddenly disappearing
again in that ‘sea.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Have you ever, my Lord Cadi, seen
any of those submarine warriors?’</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Cadi.</em>—‘No, <em>I</em> never have.’</p>

<p class='c012'>‘Can you mention any trustworthy
person of your acquaintance who has?’</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Cadi.</em>—‘I certainly cannot.’</p>

<p class='c012'>‘Then what evidence have you for the
truth of those marvellous apparitions?’</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Cadi.</em>—‘Every one believes in all I
have told you.’</p>

<p class='c012'>‘Is it not possible that all this belief
may be the result of the fevered imagination
of some superstitious individual?’</p>

<p class='c012'><em>Cadi.</em>—‘It certainly is possible,—but
all believe it.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>This wonderful “sea” is a vast
lake, dry for about nine months of
the year, extending about seventy
miles in length, by forty broad at its
widest part. It receives several
streamlets, such as the <em>Ras Elain</em> of
Nefta; and, during the rainy season,
the torrents from the mountains which
on two sides at least adjoin it. During
the winter, portions of the lake-bed
retain for a short time the waters
thus poured into it; but during the
greater part of the year, a deposit of
salt only is visible on its sandy surface.
It abounds in marshes, quicksands,
and trap-pits; and at no time
can it be crossed save by a single
route, which is pointed out by trunks
of palm-trees, placed at short distances,—and
hence its proper name,
<em>the Lake of Marks</em>. Tufts of very sickly-looking
grass, and mounds clothed
with consumptive shrubs, fringed its
shores at the time our travellers
visited it; and its surface was wavy,
and covered with saline incrustations.
Towards the north-east part
of the lake there is a kind of island,
about four miles in circumference,
which is covered with palm-trees.
The Arabs say that those trees have
grown up from the kernels left there
by Pharaoh’s troops,—and this they
regard as an additional proof that the
Egyptian monarch and his army perished
there!</p>

<p class='c009'>At last the three weeks’ stay at
Tozar drew to a close, and a most
lovely night was that which preceded
their departure. Mr Davis seldom indulges
in scenic description; and we
give the following as a rare and charming
picture of a night-scene in the
Desert:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“At half-past ten, when every inmate of
my establishment had retired to rest,—the
tranquillity, the universal stillness, and
balmy atmosphere seemed to invite me
to leave my tent again. All was serene
and calm without, and everything appeared
to inspire the mind with serious
and sober reflection.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Nature was hush’d, as if her works adored,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still’d by the presence of her living Lord.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The sultry heat of the day had now
ceased, and a cool northerly breeze gently
waved the branches of the stately palm-trees.
The darkness gradually vanished
before the bright rays of the moon, whose
silvery light streamed through the forest;
and in a few minutes, she rode high
above the loftiest of its countless trees,
and by her splendour and brilliancy so
illuminated every object around, that day
appeared again perfectly restored. And
the stars, too,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Those quenchless stars! so eloquently bright.</div>
      <div class='line'>Untroubled sentries of the shadowy night,’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>vied with each other in lustre, to contribute
to the magnificence of this majestic
scene,—to add dazzling refulgence to the
prodigious theatre exhibited for the admiration
of wondering man!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here we have our white canvass city,
and, a little beyond it, the sombre buildings
of Tozar. Here again is the thick
forest of graceful palms, with their clusters
of ‘fruits of gold,’ pendant beneath
their feathery branches. The rippling
brook flows on in its eccentric course,
bearing on its surface the reflection of the
host of stars in the firmament. All nature—animate
and inanimate—as far as my
vision could embrace, not only declared
the omnipotence and benevolence of the
great Eternal, but seemed to proclaim
universal peace and safety,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘’Twas a fair scene,—a land more bright</div>
      <div class='line'>Never did mortal eye behold!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“The only sound audible, besides
that of the sentries, and the rippling
stream close by, was the voice of a <em>dervish</em>
or saint, who was entertaining the inmates
of a tent, pitched a short distance from
mine, with some extraordinary Mecca
legends. I was on the point of re-entering
my tent, when one of the party, attracted
by the scene without, called upon
his companions to behold the wonderful
works of God. All obeyed; and my thin
texture partition enabled me to listen to
their repeated exclamations of <em>Allah
Kabeer</em>, ‘God is great!’ Thus the Moslem,
like the Christian, was led, from a survey
of the stupendous works of nature, to contemplate
nature’s omnipotent God.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We need not follow the steps of the
expedition as it slowly retraced its
path northwards through the Desert,
from oasis to oasis, till it fairly reentered
the region of verdure and perennial
waters. Nor can we stay, even
in passing, to tell of the many French
deserters who have sought refuge
among the tribes and towns of the
Sahara, nor of their strange adventures,
nor of the hardship and death
which in so many cases has overtaken
them. We merely reconduct Mr Davis,
with a velocity unknown to desert-travelling,
back to Tunis, and there
leave him. His book is a very creditable
performance,—though one-half
of it might have been as well written
(and perhaps was so) in comfortable
lodgings in London as in “My Tent”
in the Balad Ejjareed. It is not a
book of personal adventure. The author
is a reverend gentleman, who has
no ambition to rival the feats of Gordon
Cumming among the lions and
hippopotamuses of the African wastes;
still less is he inclined to become a
“free lance” in the ranks of General
Pelissier’s <i><span lang="fr">Zouaves</span></i>, and spin us thrilling
tales of hairbreadth escapes, such
as have lately issued from the press
of Germany. But he has been a considerable
time—six years—in Northern
Africa, and has made himself well
acquainted with the language and customs
of its people,—upon which subjects
we know of no writer in whom
we would place more confidence. He
is also well acquainted with the works
of adventure and travel already published
on this part of the world, and
of which he very properly makes use
to lend additional value or interest to
his own. Indeed we think we have
recognised several anecdotes in his
book which we have already quoted in
our pages, when reviewing the foreign
works in which they originally appeared.
Hence these <cite>Evenings in my
Tent</cite> do not contain so much fresh
matter as we anticipated; yet the
substance of their pages is, on the
whole, both good and readable—if we
except the antiquated chapter on the
Slave-trade, and a few passages
where the author’s clerical habits
incline him to sermonise rather more
than may suit the tastes of his lay
readers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>
  <h2 class='c002'>THE COST OF THE COALITION MINISTRY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is probable that ere these pages
issue from the press, war will have
been formally declared with Russia,
and Great Britain will be irretrievably
engaged in a contest of which it is
impossible to see the termination.
Already our choicest troops have left
our shores for the Mediterranean, inspired
by the cheers and accompanied
by the blessing of many hundreds of
thousands of their fellow-countrymen,
who, for the first time in their lives,
have witnessed so solemn yet exciting
a spectacle. Already has a noble fleet
sailed for the waters of the Baltic, to
sweep that inland sea, and to launch
its thunders against the foe. Wellnigh
forty years have elapsed since
such din of martial preparation has
been heard. On the last occasion,
Russia and Britain were combined
against France—now, Britain and
France are combined together against
Russia. Such a struggle, so commenced,
must be a desperate, but not
therefore necessarily a short one. We
cannot yet calculate on the part to
be taken by the central powers of
Europe; for, notwithstanding Lord
Clarendon’s assurance that Austria
is with us, we have every reason to
believe that the government of that
country is so closely leagued with
Russia, that when compelled to throw
off its appearance of neutrality, its
forces will be ranged upon her side.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
We cannot depend upon the cordial
co-operation of Prussia—which power,
besides having no direct interest in the
Eastern quarrel, is intimately allied
with Russia, and has always acted,
during times of European disturbance,
with a view to its own aggrandisement.
It would be folly to underrate
the magnitude of the contest in
which we are engaging. The re-pacification
of Europe cannot be achieved
without an enormous expenditure of
blood and treasure, and without very
considerable alterations in its territorial
adjustment. The war once
begun, Russia will know that she is
fighting, not for the occupation of the
Danubian provinces, but for the retention
of the territories which she
has absorbed or pillaged from her
neighbours. The penalty she must
pay in the event of defeat is dismemberment,
and she will resist that to
the uttermost.</p>

<p class='c009'>We must not, therefore, blind ourselves
to consequences, which, in so
far as human judgment can go, appear
to be inevitable. We may be able to
disperse or even to annihilate the
Russian fleets in the Baltic and the
Black seas—we may be able to prevent
the colossal northern power from
crossing the Danube, or even beat it
back from the Principalities—but the
contest will not end there. We are on
the verge of a general European embroilment,
in which there will not
only be wars, but bloody revolutions;
and as we have been the first to enter,
so we must be the last to withdraw.
We do not say this for the purpose of
checking enthusiasm—God forbid!
We are already committed to the
struggle; and if in the minds of any
there has lingered a doubt as to the
propriety of Christian intervention for
the maintenance of a Mahometan
power in Europe, that ought to be
dispelled by the revelations recently
made of the objects of the Russian
ambition. The Czar is no crusader;
nor is he influenced by any tender regard
for the religious liberties of the
Christian population dwelling beneath
the government of the Sultan. He
has set his eyes upon Turkey, just as
Catherine in 1772 fixed hers upon
Poland, and he has had the astounding
effrontery to propose that Great
Britain should take part in the spoliation.
Here is his own proposition,
as communicated to Lord John Russell,
by Sir G. H. Seymour, in his despatch
of 22d February 1853:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Emperor went on to say that, in
the event of the dissolution of the Ottoman
empire, he thought it might be less difficult
to arrive at a satisfactory territorial arrangement
than was commonly believed.
‘The Principalities are,’ he said, ‘in fact an
independent state under my protection;
this might so continue. Servia might receive
the same form of government. So
again with Bulgaria. There seems to be
no reason this province should not form
an independent state. As to Egypt, I
quite understand the importance to England
of that territory. <em>I can then only
say that if, in the event of a distribution of
the Ottoman succession upon the fall of the
empire, you should take possession of Egypt,
I shall have no objections to offer. I would
say the same thing of Candia: that island
might suit you, and I do not know why it
should not become an English possession.</em>’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Such was the language used by the
Emperor of Russia to the British minister
at the Court of St Petersburg,
and we really cannot imagine anything
more absolutely infamous. It
was a bribe, tendered evidently in the
belief that it would be accepted; and
the offer ought to have been at once
most indignantly repelled. Was it so?
We shall see presently—for the correspondence
recently published is far
too remarkable and momentous to be
passed over with a single extract from
its contents.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Government of Lord Aberdeen,
it will be remembered, acceded to
office in the latter part of December
1852. On the 9th of January following,
the Emperor Nicholas, at a private
meeting in the palace of the Grand-duchess
Helen, thus approached Sir G.
H. Seymour. We shall be as short in
quotation as possible; but it is absolutely
necessary that the leading
points of such an extraordinary transaction
as this should be kept before
the public view. We quote from Sir
Hamilton Seymour’s despatch to Lord
John Russell, then Foreign Secretary,
of date 11th January 1853:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Emperor came up to me, in the
most gracious manner, to say that he had
heard with great pleasure of Her Majesty’s
Government having been definitively
formed, <em>adding that he trusted the
Ministry would be of long duration</em>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“His Imperial Majesty desired me <em>particularly
to convey this assurance to the
Earl of Aberdeen</em>, with whom, he said, he
had been acquainted for nearly forty
years, and for whom he entertained equal
regard and esteem. His Majesty desired
to be brought to the kind recollection of
his Lordship.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then follows the report of some expressions
regarding the close amity
which ought to prevail between the
two countries, and their community
of interests, which, being general,
we may pass over: but Nicholas
speedily comes to the point—</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the mean time, the Emperor went
on to say—‘I repeat, that it is very essential
that the two Governments—that is,
that the English Government and I, and
I and the English Government—should
be upon the best terms; <em>and the necessity
was never greater than at present</em>. I beg
you to convey these words to Lord John
Russell. When we are agreed (<i><span lang="fr">d’accord</span></i>),
I am quite without anxiety to the west of
Europe; it is immaterial what the others
may think or do. As <em>to Turkey, that is
another question</em>; that country is in a
critical state, and may give us all a great
deal of trouble. And now I will take my
leave of you,’ which His Majesty proceeded
to do by shaking hands with me
very graciously.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Czar probably thought that he
had said enough in the first instance,
and that it would be prudent to allow
Sir Hamilton Seymour to chew, for a
day or two, the cud of thought. But
that active and astute diplomatist saw
that something more than common
was intended, and pressed for a further
explanation. The following conversation
is certainly as curious as any
which is recorded in the pages of
history:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Sir,’ I observed, ‘your Majesty has
been good enough to charge me with
general assurances as to the identity of
views between the two Cabinets, which
assuredly have given me the greatest
pleasure, and will be received with equal
satisfaction in England; but I should be
particularly glad that your Majesty should
add a few words which may tend to calm
the anxiety with regard to the affairs of
Turkey, which passing events are so calculated
to excite on the part of Her Majesty’s
Government. Perhaps you will
be pleased to charge me with some additional
assurances of this kind.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Emperor’s words and manner,
although still very kind, showed that His
Majesty <em>had no intention of speaking to
me of the demonstration which he is about
to make in the South</em>. He said, however,
at first with a little hesitation, but, as he
proceeded, in an open and unhesitating
manner—‘The affairs of Turkey are in a
very disorganised condition; the country
itself seems to be falling to pieces (<i><span lang="fr">menace
ruine</span></i>); the fall will be a great misfortune,
and it is very important that England
and Russia should come to a perfectly
good understanding upon these
affairs, and that neither should take any
decisive step of which the other is not
apprised.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“I observed in a few words, that I rejoiced
to hear that His Imperial Majesty
held this language; that this was certainly
the view I took of the manner in
which Turkish questions were to be
treated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Tenez,’ the Emperor said, as if proceeding
with his remark, ‘tenez; nous
avons sur les bras un homme malade—un
homme gravement malade; ce sera, je
vous le dis franchement, un grand malheur
si, un de ces jours, il devait nous
échapper, surtout avant que toutes les
dispositions nécessaires fussent prises.
Mais enfin ce n’est point le moment de
vous parler de cela.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was clear that the Emperor did
not intend to prolong the conversation.
I therefore said, ‘<span lang="fr">Votre Majesté est si
gracieuse qu’elle me permettra de lui
faire encore une observation. Votre
Majesté dit que l’homme est malade;
c’est bien vrai, mais votre Majesté
daignera m’excuser si je lui fais observer,
que c’est à l’homme généreux et fort de
ménager l’homme malade et faible.</span>’</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Emperor then took leave of me
in a manner which conveyed the impression
of my having, at least, not given
offence, and again expressed his intention
of sending for me on some future day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is proper to subjoin Sir Hamilton
Seymour’s own impressions of this
interview, as communicated to Lord
John Russell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your Lordship will pardon me if I
remark that, after reflecting attentively
upon my conversation with the Emperor,
it appears to me that this, and any overture
of the kind which may be made,
tends to establish a dilemma by which it
is very desirable that Her Majesty’s Government
should not allow themselves to
be fettered. The dilemma seems to be
this:—If her Majesty’s Government do
not come to an understanding with Russia
as to what is to happen in the event of
the sudden downfall of Turkey, they will
have the less reason for complaining if
results displeasing to England should be
prepared. If, on the contrary, Her Majesty’s
Government should enter into the
consideration of such eventualities, they
make themselves in some degree consenting
parties to a catastrophe which they
have so much interest in warding off as
long as possible.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sum is probably this:—That England
has to desire a close concert with
Russia, with a view to preventing the
downfall of Turkey; while Russia would
be well pleased that the concert should
apply to the events by which this downfall
is to be followed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In a postscript to this despatch, we
learn that the Emperor had communicated
<em>to the Austrian Minister</em> the
tenor of the above conversation. That
circumstance is, to say the least of it,
significant.</p>

<p class='c009'>Five days afterwards, Sir Hamilton
Seymour waited upon the Emperor,
at the request of the latter, and was
favoured from the imperial lips with a
remarkably choice specimen of what
our Irish friends denominate <em>blarney</em>.
The Czar began by asseverating that
he had not the least intention of increasing
the extent of his territorial
dominions. The only danger, he said,
which he could foresee to Russia
would arise from an extension given
to an empire already too large. From
this general statement he presently
condescended to particulars.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Close to us lies Turkey, and, in our
present condition, nothing better for our
interests can be desired; the times have
gone by when we had anything to fear
from the fanatical spirit or the military
enterprise of the Turks, and yet the country
is strong enough, or has hitherto been
strong enough, to preserve its independence,
and to insure respectful treatment
from other countries.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These were, we venture to think,
injudicious premises on the part of the
Emperor, for they are tantamount to
an admission that Turkey, if left
alone, was quite able to maintain its
own position. We are not quite sure
that the same could be said of Austria,
which, but a few years ago, owed its
integrity to the intervention of Russian
bayonets. Be that as it may, the Emperor
went on to state that he had the
right of surveillance over some millions
of Christians in the Ottoman empire—a
right which he regarded as a duty,
but used sparingly, because it was
“attended with obligations occasionally
very inconvenient.” And then we
arrive at a statement, quite inconsistent,
we think, with what had gone
before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, Turkey, in the condition which
I have described, has by degrees fallen
into such a state of decrepitude, that, as
I told you the other night, <em>eager as we all
are for the prolonged existence of the man</em>
(and that I am as desirous as you can be
for the continuance of his life, I beg you
to believe), he may suddenly die upon
our hands (<i><span lang="fr">nous rester sur les bras</span></i>); we
cannot resuscitate what is dead: if the
Turkish empire falls, it falls to rise no
more; and I put it to you, therefore,
whether it is not better to be provided
beforehand for a contingency, than to incur
the chaos, confusion, and the certainty
of a European war, all of which must attend
the catastrophe if it should occur
unexpectedly, and before some ulterior
system has been sketched? This is the
point to which I am desirous that you
should call the attention of your Government.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We had better give <i><span lang="fr">in extenso</span></i> the
conversation which immediately followed;
because we think that Sir
Hamilton Seymour might, without
any breach of propriety, have used
more decided language than he did
employ, with regard to the view likely
to be taken by the British Cabinet.
We are quite aware of the difficulties
of an ambassador in such a situation;
still we cannot avoid the conclusion
that Sir H. Seymour was unnecessarily
timid, and not nearly decided
enough in the tone which he assumed.
He objected, indeed, but the objection
was rather feeble; which was unfortunate,
as his principal in England
immediately adopted the like inconclusive
tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Sir,’ I replied, ‘your Majesty is so
frank with me that I am sure you will
have the goodness to permit me to speak
with the same openness. I would then
observe that, deplorable as is the condition
of Turkey, it is a country which has
long been plunged in difficulties supposed
by many to be insurmountable. With
regard to contingent arrangements, her
Majesty’s Government, as your Majesty
is well aware, objects, as a general rule
to taking engagements upon possible
eventualities, and would, perhaps, be particularly
disinclined to doing so in this
instance. If I may be allowed to say so,
a great disinclination (<i><span lang="fr">répugnance</span></i>) might
be expected in England to disposing by
anticipation (<i><span lang="fr">d’escompter</span></i>) of the succession
of an old friend and ally.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘The rule is a good one,’ the Emperor
replied, ‘good at all times, especially in
times of uncertainty and change, like the
present: still it is of the greatest importance
that we should understand one an
other, and not allow events to take us by
surprise; <span lang="fr">maintenant je désire vous parler
en ami et en <em>gentleman</em>; si nous arrivons
à nous entendre sur cette affaire,
l’Angleterre et moi, pour le reste peu
m’importe; il m’est indifferent ce que
font ou pensent les autres. Usant donc
de franchise, je vous dis nettement, que
si l’Angleterre songe à s’établir un de ces
jours à Constantinople, je ne le permettrai
pas; je ne vous prête point ces intentions,
mais il vaut mieux dans ces
occasions parler clairement; de mon côté,
je suis également disposé de prendre l’engagement
de ne pas m’y établir, <em>en propriétaire
il s’entend, car en dépositaire je
ne dis pas</em>; il pourrait se faire que les
circonstances me misent dans le cas d’occuper
Constantinople, si rien ne se trouve
prévu, si l’on doit tout laisser aller au
hazard.</span>’</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thanked his Majesty for the frankness
of his declarations, and for the desire
which he had expressed of acting cordially
and openly with her Majesty’s Government,
observing at the same time that
such an understanding appeared the best
security against the sudden danger to
which his Majesty had alluded. I added
that, although unprepared to give a decided
opinion upon questions of such magnitude
and delicacy, it appeared to me possible
that some such arrangement might be
made between her Majesty’s Government
and his Majesty as might guard, if not
for, at least against certain contingencies.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To render my meaning more clear,” I
said, further, “I can only repeat, Sir, that
in my opinion her Majesty’s Government
will be indisposed to make certain arrangements
connected with the downfall of
Turkey, <em>but it is possible that they may be
ready to pledge themselves against certain
arrangements which might, in that event, be
attempted</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We have no desire whatever to reflect
upon the conduct of the prudence
of Sir Hamilton Seymour, but we
cannot help saying that he seems to
have missed one very material point—that
being <em>a distinct explanation of
the quarter from which the anticipated
danger to Turkey was to arise</em>. Sir
Hamilton was perfectly justified in
intimating that Britain did not intend
to subvert the integrity of Turkey,
and that she would not be passive if
France were to manifest such a design.
There was no earthly danger
from either quarter; and certainly
Austria, whatever she may wish to
have or is ready to receive, would not
have dared, under existing circumstances,
to disturb the peace of Europe.
Turkey itself was in a far
better position than it ever had been.
“L’homme gravement malade,” was
exhibiting every symptom of convalescence,
and the only danger to be
apprehended was from the Muscovite
doctor, who, without being summoned,
was preparing to administer his pills.
Therefore, we think that the rejoinder
to the Emperor’s confidences—subject,
of course, to the official Cabinet
approval—should have been in the
shape of a query as to the nature of
the apprehended danger. The Czar
had protested, in the most emphatic
language, that he was “eager for the
prolonged existence of the man;”
and, if that were the case, his dissolution
was an event much less likely
than that of many a dynasty of
Christian Europe. With Russia and
Britain as determined protectors, who
was to give him the <i><span lang="fr">coup-de-grace</span></i>?
Surely Sir Hamilton Seymour erred
in not putting that point more forcibly
and distinctly in his confidential conversations
with the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c009'>We say this, because the last paragraph
in Sir Hamilton Seymour’s
despatch, of 22d January 1853, to
Lord John Russell shows that he
was not altogether uninfluenced by
the Imperial blandishments and affectation
of perfect sincerity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A noble triumph would be obtained
by the civilisation of the nineteenth century
if the void left by the extinction of Mahommedan
rule in Europe could be filled up
without an interruption of the general
peace, in consequence of the precautions
adopted by the two principal Governments
the most interested in the destinies
of Turkey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Precautions indeed! Precautions
which would have made Russia, without
assuming the name of proprietor,
the virtual and absolute occupier of
Constantinople, with the power of the
keys of the Bosphorus! It is marvellous
that so acute a minister as Sir
Hamilton Seymour—who otherwise
deserves great praise for his lucid
exposition of the designs and motives
of the Czar—did not perceive that
any approach to an arrangement
for disposing of the inheritance, was
tantamount to a declaration of the
immediate dissolution of Turkey.</p>

<p class='c009'>In answer to these communications,
Lord John Russell, on the 9th February,
forwarded a despatch, of the wisdom
of which it is for the public to
form their own opinion. It commences
with an acknowledgment of “the moderation,
the frankness, and the friendly
disposition of his Imperial Majesty.”
Why the first of these terms should
have been employed, we really do
not comprehend. Then Lord John,
adverting to the indirect proposal of
the Emperor, observes that—“In
considering this grave question, the first
reflection which occurs to Her Majesty’s
Government is, that no actual crisis
has occurred which renders necessary
a solution of this vast European problem”—that
“there is no sufficient
cause for intimating to the Sultan that
he cannot keep peace at home, or preserve
friendly relations with his neighbours”—and
that “it occurs further
to her Majesty’s Government to remark
that the event which is contemplated
is not definitely fixed in point
of time.” After pointing out the impropriety
as well as the impolicy of
devising a partition for providing for
a settlement under such circumstances,
Lord John intimates, in tolerably
distinct terms, that “neither England
nor France, nor probably Austria,
would be content to see Constantinople
permanently in the hands of
Russia.” He then draws the following
conclusions:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Upon the whole, then, Her Majesty’s
Government are persuaded that no course
of policy can be adopted more wise, more
disinterested, more beneficial to Europe,
than that which His Imperial Majesty
has so long followed, and which will
render his name more illustrious than
that of the most famous sovereigns who
have sought immortality by unprovoked
conquest and ephemeral glory.</p>

<p class='c012'>“With a view to the success of this
policy, it is desirable that the utmost forbearance
should be manifested towards
Turkey; that any demands which the
Great Powers of Europe may have to
make should be made matter of friendly
negotiation rather than of peremptory
demand; that military and naval demonstrations
to coerce the Sultan should as
much as possible be avoided; that differences
with respect to matters affecting
Turkey, within the competence of the
Sublime Porte, should be decided after
mutual concert between the great powers,
and not be forced upon the weakness
of the Turkish Government.”</p>

<p class='c008'>To this succeeds a passage which we
cannot help considering as unfortunate,
because it gives decided colour
to the Russian pretext, that a protectorate
over Turkey was necessary for
securing the rights of the Christian
inhabitants. There was no occasion
whatever for its introduction, especially
as the Emperor had not thought
it necessary to ask advice upon the
subject:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“To these cautions Her Majesty’s
Government wish to add, that in their
view it is essential that the Sultan should
be advised to treat his Christian subjects
in conformity with the principles
of equity and religious freedom which
prevail generally among the enlightened
nations of Europe. The more the Turkish
Government adopts the rules of impartial
law and equal administration, the
less will the Emperor of Russia find it
necessary to apply that exceptional protection
which his Imperial Majesty has
found so burdensome and inconvenient,
though no doubt prescribed by duty and
sanctioned by treaty.</p>

<p class='c008'>We observe that the <cite>Times</cite>, notwithstanding
its notorious ministerial
leaning, has declined awarding praise
to this state document, and we are
not surprised at it. It is dissuasive
and declinatory, but it is altogether
feeble. We should have expected
to find in it, not hypocritical acknowledgments
of Imperial moderation
and so forth, but a distinct,
firm, and energetic protest against
any attempt to disturb the peace,
or to violate the integrity of Turkey.
The infamous proposals made to
Britain—for they were infamous not
only as regarded Turkey but other European
powers—should have been rejected
in a manner that could have left
no doubt in the mind of the Czar as to
the part which the British Government
was prepared to take in the event of his
entering into hostilities with the Sultan.
From the beginning to the end
of this despatch there is not a single
word which can be construed into a
plain warning to the Czar, that any
attempt made by him upon Turkey
would provoke the hostility of Britain.
On the contrary, the declinature to
participate in the scheme is mainly
founded on the fact that no “actual
crisis” has yet arrived; but there is
nothing said to indicate that Britain
would oppose the forcing on of such a
crisis, if Russia thought proper to
precipitate it; and a more unlucky
expression than “<em>that the event which
was contemplated is not definitely fixed
in point of time</em>” it is utterly impossible
to conceive. The perusal of
this despatch could leave no other impression
upon the mind of the Czar,
than that the British Ministry were
afraid to commit themselves by entering
into any secret or separate treaty
with Russia for the disposal of the
Turkish dominions, until a crisis
actually should occur. That they
would have preferred the maintenance
of the <i><span lang="la">status quo</span></i> to a disturbance
of it, was tolerably clear; but it was
not in the least degree clear that they
would take umbrage at an act of aggression,
or be indisposed to treat with
Russia after the aggression was made,
and the weakness of the Ottoman
empire exhibited by its being forced
to succumb to the attack of the northern
Colossus. The despatch, in
short, was not couched in such manly,
distinct, and positive terms as a
British Secretary of State for foreign
affairs should have employed on such
an occasion. It is weak, timid, and
almost subservient; and we are not in
the least degree surprised to find that
the Czar considered that it gave him
sufficient encouragement again to renew
his attack. Here is an extract
from his next conversation with the
British envoy, Sir Hamilton Seymour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I think your Government does not
well understand my object. I am not so
eager about what shall be done when the
sick man dies, as I am to determine with
England what shall not be done upon
that event taking place.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘But, sir,’ I replied, ‘allow me to
observe, that we have no reason to think
that the sick man (to use your Majesty’s
expression) is dying. We are as much
interested as we believe your Majesty to
be in his continuing to live; while, for
myself, I will venture to remark that experience
shows me that countries do not
die in such a hurry. Turkey will remain
for many a year, unless some unforeseen
crisis should occur. It is precisely, sir,
for the avoidance of all circumstances
likely to produce such a crisis that Her
Majesty’s Government reckons upon your
generous assistance.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Then,’ rejoined the Emperor, ‘I will
tell you that, if your Government has
been led to believe that Turkey retains
any elements of existence, your Government
must have received incorrect information.
I repeat to you, that the sick
man is dying; and we can never allow
such an event to take us by surprise.
We must come to some understanding;
and this we should do, I am convinced, if
I could hold but ten minutes’ conversation
with your Ministers—with Lord Aberdeen,
for instance, who knows me so well,
who has full confidence in me, as I have
in him. And, remember, I do not ask for
a treaty or a protocol; a general understanding
is all I require—that between
gentlemen is sufficient; and in this case I
am certain that the confidence would be
as great on the side of the Queen’s Ministers
as on mine.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>The despatch, containing the report
of this conversation, was written on
the 21st February, and received at the
Foreign Office on 6th March 1853;
so that the Emperor Nicholas, whatever
may be thought of his conduct
otherwise, cannot be justly charged
with deliberate perfidy in concealing
his views from our Government. Indeed,
Sir Hamilton Seymour, in this
very document, gave Lord John Russell
a distinct intimation of the real
objects of the Czar.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It can hardly be otherwise but that
the Sovereign, who insists with such pertinacity
upon the impending fall of a
neighbouring state, must have settled in
his own mind that the hour, if not of its
dissolution, at all events for its dissolution,
must be at hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then, as now, I reflected that this
assumption would hardly be ventured
upon unless some, perhaps general, but at
all events intimate understanding, existed
<em>between Russia and Austria</em>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Supposing my suspicion to be well
founded, the Emperor’s object is to engage
Her Majesty’s Government, in conjunction
with his own Cabinet and that of
Vienna, in some scheme for the ultimate
partition of Turkey, and for the exclusion
of France from the arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>On the following day a more particular,
and, if possible, more interesting,
conversation took place between
the Czar and the British envoy. We
regret extremely that our limits will
not allow us to detail this so fully as
we could wish, but we shall advert to
the principal points, which were in the
form of a commentary upon Lord John
Russell’s despatch. The Emperor
began by saying,—</p>

<p class='c010'>“That he was, perhaps, even more interested
than England could be in preventing
a Turkish catastrophe, but that it was
constantly impending; that it might be
brought about at any moment, either by
an external war, or by a feud between
the old Turkish party and that of the
‘new superficial French reforms,’ or again,
by a rising of the Christians, already
known to be very impatient of shaking off
the Mussulman yoke. As regards the
first cause, the Emperor said that he had
a good right to advert to it, inasmuch as,
if he had not stopped the victorious progress
of General Diebitch in 1829, the
Sultan’s authority would have been at
an end.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Next he descanted upon what could
<em>not</em> be permitted in the event of a
break-up of the Ottoman empire.
This is perhaps the most curious passage
of the whole.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Well, there are several things which
I never will tolerate; I will begin by
ourselves. I will not tolerate <em>the permanent
occupation</em> of Constantinople by the
Russians; having said this, I will say
that it never shall be held by the English,
or French, or any other great nation.
Again, I never will permit an attempt at
the reconstruction of a Byzantine empire,
or such an extension of Greece as would
render her a powerful state; still less
will I permit the breaking up of Turkey
into little republics, asylums for the
Kossuths and Mazzinis, and other revolutionists
of Europe; rather than submit
any of these arrangements I would go to
war, and as long as I have a man and a
musket left would carry it on. These,’
the Emperor said, ‘are at once some ideas;
now give me some in return.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was an awkward demand, but
Sir H. Seymour seems to have acquitted
himself with sufficient adroitness.
He put the following case: “How
would it be if, in the event of any
catastrophe occurring in Turkey, Russia
and England were to declare that
no Power should be allowed to take
possession of its provinces; that the
property should remain, as it were,
under seals, until amicable arrangements
could be made as to its adjudication?”
Of course this notion could
not be countenanced; and the Emperor’s
reply allowed Sir Hamilton
the opportunity of making the following
remark:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Sir,’ I then observed, ‘if your Majesty
will allow me to speak plainly, I would
say that the great difference between us
is this—that you continue to dwell upon
the fall of Turkey, and the arrangements
requisite before and after the fall; and
that we, on the contrary, look to Turkey
remaining where she is, and to the precautions
which are necessary for preventing
her condition from becoming worse.’
‘Ah!’ replied the Emperor, ‘that is
what the Chancellor is perpetually telling
me; but the catastrophe will occur some
day, and will take us all unawares.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then follows a passage of very great
interest at the present moment, when
the course which Austria may adopt is
still matter of speculation. Our impression
has been, and is, that she will
ultimately co-operate with Russia.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Being desirous, if possible, of ascertaining
whether there was any understanding
between the Cabinets of St
Petersburg and Vienna, I added, ‘But
your Majesty has forgotten Austria; now
all these Eastern questions affect her
very nearly; she, of course, would expect
to be consulted.’ ‘Oh!’ replied the
Emperor, greatly to my surprise, ‘but
you must understand that when I speak
of Russia I speak of Austria as well:
what suits the one suits the other; our
interests as regards Turkey are perfectly
identical.’ I should have been glad to
make another inquiry or two upon this
subject, but I did not venture to do so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Next comes the bribe—for we can
call it nothing else—implied in the
Emperor’s statement, already quoted,
that he saw no reason why, in the
event of the dissolution of the Ottoman
empire, Great Britain should not
obtain possession of Egypt and Candia!
And so completely does he seem
to have considered that point settled,
that a few days afterwards, and without
any further intercourse with Britain
(for so we are given to understand),
a confidential memorandum,
dictated by the Czar, and containing
the following passage, was placed in
the hands of Sir Hamilton Seymour:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“In short, the Emperor cannot but
congratulate himself at having given occasion
for this intimate interchange of
confidential communications between Her
Majesty and himself. He has found
therein valuable assurances, of which he
takes note with a lively satisfaction. The
two Sovereigns have frankly explained to
each other, what in the extreme case of
which they have been treating, their respective
interests cannot endure. England
understands that Russia cannot suffer
the establishment at Constantinople
of a Christian Power sufficiently strong
to control and disquiet her. She declares,
that for herself she renounces any intention
or desire to possess Constantinople.
The Emperor equally disclaims any wish
or design of establishing himself there.
England promises that she will enter into
no arrangement for determining the measures
to be taken in the event of the fall
of the Turkish empire, without a previous
understanding with the Emperor. The
Emperor, on his side, willingly contracts
the same engagement. As he is aware
that in such a case he can equally reckon
upon Austria, who is bound by her promises
to concert with him, he regards
with less apprehension the catastrophe
which he still desires to prevent, and
avert as much as it shall depend on him
to do so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This is, perhaps, the most extraordinary
note that was ever issued.
If founded upon nothing else than
Lord John Russell’s single despatch
of 9th February 1853, it is an attempt
to make a memorandum supply the
place of a treaty, and that not with
regard to existing circumstances, but
to a contingency involving the destruction
of an ally. The Emperor
must, indeed, have had great faith in
the subserviency of the British Cabinet
to his views, before he could have
ventured on such a step. Lord Clarendon
now comes into action, as the
successor of Lord John Russell in the
Home Office; but we need not pursue
the correspondence further than to
say, that it was conducted on the
same principle of remonstrance, though
very feeble on the part of the British
Minister, against the assumption that
Turkey was absolutely in a critical
state, and of assertion to the contrary
on the part of the Czar. His
object was to alienate Britain from
France—to keep the latter power out
of any arrangement which might be
made for the partition of the Turkish
territories—and to hasten the crisis as
fast as possible, in order that Britain
might be compelled to come to definite
terms. Lord Clarendon’s despatches
are couched in terms quite unworthy
of his position. Lord John Russell,
who had primarily to state the views
of the British Cabinet, may be excused
for a certain weakness of expression;
but no such apology can be
made for Lord Clarendon, who was
bound emphatically to have informed
the Czar that this country disdained
his proposals, and was prepared, at
any hazard, to maintain the integrity
of Turkey. We say that he was
bound to have done so, on the supposition
that the Aberdeen Ministry
disapproved of the partition of Turkey,
and were prepared, by force of
arms, to oppose it. Disapproval is of
two kinds: There is the faint remonstrance,
which is usually considered
to imply reluctant consent; and there
is strong distinct denial, which cannot
possibly be misinterpreted. We find
no such strong distinct denial in Lord
Clarendon’s despatches. They are
filled with almost fulsome adulation
of the Czar, who had previously tendered
a bribe. Thus, in the despatch
of 23d March, we find the following
passage:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“The generous confidence exhibited by
the Emperor entitles His Imperial Majesty
to the most cordial declaration of
opinion on the part of Her Majesty’s
Government, who are fully aware that,
in the event of any understanding with
reference to future contingencies being
expedient, or indeed possible, the word
of His Imperial Majesty would be preferable
to any convention that could be
framed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Scarce less miserably sycophantish
are the terms of the despatch of April
5th. “My despatch of the 23d ult. will
have furnished you with answers upon
all the principal points alluded to in
the memorandum which Count Nesselrode
placed in your hands; but it is
my duty to inform you that that important
and remarkable document was
received by her Majesty’s Government
with feelings of sincere satisfaction, as
a renewed proof of the Emperor’s confidence
and friendly feelings; and her
Majesty’s Government desire to convey
their acknowledgments to his Imperial
Majesty for having thus placed
on record the opinions he expressed
at the interview with which you were
honoured by his Imperial Majesty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We do not profess to know much
about the language of diplomacy; but
if these are the sort of terms to be addressed
to an avowed disturber of the
peace of Europe, who has attempted
to engage us in a conspiracy by offer
of a bribe, we are at a loss to know
what language can afford by way of
adequate encomium to a really honest
ally. The excuse of sincere belief in
the sincerity of the Czar is entirely
precluded by the terms of the previous
communications from Sir Hamilton
Seymour, which not only indicate but
demonstrate the game which the Autocrat
was playing. It is certainly
remarkable to observe the extreme
cordiality with which the Emperor
greeted the accession of his old friend,
Lord Aberdeen, to power, and the fervency
of his wishes for his long continuance
in office. Immediately thereafter—or
rather on the same occasion—he
begins to develop his designs
upon Turkey, states his prognosis of
the condition of the sick gentleman,
and requests to be informed what are
our views as to the partition of his property.
Our Ministers demur as to the
fact of the sickness; but the Imperial
Doctor assures them that it is so, or
shall immediately be so, and states
that he will be contented with a temporary
occupation of the dying man’s
domicile—the catastrophe to be hastened
by a bolus of his own administration—but
that we are perfectly welcome
to seize upon certain outlying
hereditaments! And in return to such
proposals, which, if agreed to, would
have made us deservedly infamous
throughout Europe, the Ministers of
Queen Victoria think fit to beslaver the
Czar! Since the days of Charles II.
England has seen no similar instance
of adulation to a foreign potentate.</p>

<p class='c009'>The correspondence is now before
the world, and the public must decide
whether it is such as to justify Lord
Aberdeen’s assertion, in reply to Lord
Derby, “that if he thought it would
be found to contain anything on which
a charge could be founded against the
Government, he would find himself
egregiously mistaken.” Undoubtedly
they are not chargeable with connivance—but
they are chargeable
with incapacity and misconduct so
gross, that even connivance could not
have produced effects more disastrous.
If they did not play directly into the
hands of the Czar, they failed to make
him aware of the part which they
were bound to take should he persist
in his nefarious designs. They manifested
no kind of honourable indignation
at his offers; they received his
cajolements with complacency, and
paid him back with compliments and
assurances not one whit more sincere
than his own. If this really is the
style in which our diplomatic intercourse
is usually conducted, there is
ample room for a reform. They cannot
with justice assert that the Emperor
was keeping them in the dark
as to the nature of his own projects.
He was, on the contrary, particularly
frank. He insisted, over and over
again, that Turkey was on the eve of
dissolution; he even indicated that
he might himself be the agent to force
on that catastrophe—and yet Lord
Aberdeen and his colleagues are now
maintaining that he had deceived
them! How, where, and when were
they deceived? He showed them
the victim, prophesied his immediate
death, intimated that the fatal deathblow
might be given by his hand, told
them that he was in accord with
Austria, invited them to declare their
wishes as to the subsequent partition,
and emphatically assured them that
there was no time to be lost. Let us
call things by their proper names.
Stigmatise the conduct of the Czar,
if you will, as ambitious, tyrannical,
unprincipled, or nefarious—but do not
accuse him of having concealed his
purpose from the British Ministry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Were the Ministers then so blind
that they failed to perceive his purpose?
Of course they were not. The
Cabinet which contained Lords Aberdeen
and Palmerston, both of them
experienced in foreign affairs, could
be at no loss to divine his meaning,
even if that had been more obscurely
expressed; and consequently we must
conclude that so early as March 1853
they were put thoroughly on their
guard. They were aware that the
Czar meditated the destruction of the
Ottoman empire, and having that
knowledge, every movement of his in
the East, whether diplomatic or military,
could only be regarded as progressive
means towards the end proposed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now there were two courses open
to Ministers. The one was to have
intimated at once, without any circumlocution
or compliment, that Great
Britain would not submit to any invasion
of the Turkish territories on
the part of a European power, but
would be prepared, by force of arms,
to resist any such attempt. That
would have been a manly and honourable
course; and we are satisfied that,
if adopted, the Czar would not have
had the temerity to provoke a crisis.
Unfortunately no declaration was
made. A faint dissuasive, accompanied
by an immense deal of complimentary
sugar, was all that our
Ministers ventured to tender; and
the Czar was accordingly allowed to
proceed, under the evident impression
that Great Britain would not actively
interfere to prevent his designs upon
Turkey, any more than she interfered
to prevent those of his ancestress upon
Poland.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other course was to have maintained
a strict neutrality, and to have
treated the Eastern question as an
affair entirely between Russia and
Turkey. To that, however, it is more
than doubtful whether the people of this
country would have submitted. The
appetite of Russia for territorial aggrandisement
is so insatiable, and her
advances have been pushed so far,
that the virtual cession to her of so
fair and fertile a country as Turkey,
and the entire command of the entrance
to the Black Sea, would, very
justly, have been deemed an act of
culpable cowardice. Setting aside
the position of India, and the facilities
which the occupation of Turkey would
afford for any hostile demonstration
upon that part of our dominions, we
have now, in consequence of Free
Trade, a direct interest in the Danubian
Principalities, as so many granaries
for our home consumption.
Since we ceased to act upon the principle
of growing corn for our own
population, and made ourselves dependent
upon foreign supplies, it
would be suicidal to give Russia the
power of cutting us short both in the
north and on the south—in the Baltic
and the Black Seas. Still that was
the only other course which Ministers
could consistently have adopted, if
they wished to avoid or postpone the
terrible calamity of a war.</p>

<p class='c009'>They followed neither the one course
nor the other. They did not tell the
Czar that, if he persisted in the schemes
which he had disclosed to them, he
must be prepared to meet Britain in
the field; nor did they tell him that,
in so far as they were concerned,
he might do what he pleased with
Turkey. <span class='sc'>They halted between
two opinions.</span> In full knowledge
of his designs, they allowed him to
commit himself—to pick a quarrel
with Turkey about some rubbish relating
to the keys of the Holy Places—to
march his forces across the Pruth—to
occupy the Principalities,—to do,
in short, the work of one effective
campaign. They never intimated to
the country that the religious questions,—on
which Russia, with scandalous
hypocrisy, rested her justification
of invasion,—were mere pretexts
to mask the avowed intentions
of Nicholas. They did not even send
a fleet at once to Constantinople, but
kept it hovering between Malta and
Besika Bay, in the attitude of observation,
long after the Russian guns
were roaring upon the Danube. Is
it fair to suppose that Nicholas,—after
having frankly communicated
to them his intentions more than a
twelvemonth ago; after having told
them that the sick gentleman was sure
to die immediately; and after having
taken measures to secure the fulfilment
of that prophecy,—could consider their
late hesitating and dilatory movement
as otherwise than a convenient sham?
It must have appeared to him that if
the British Government was determined
to oppose his project, they
would at once have said so, with the
same openness which he manifested in
his communications to them. They said
nothing of the kind. They gave him
fulsome compliments. Of course he
went farther, and marched into the
sick man’s territory. What did our
Ministers then? <em>They concealed what
they knew</em>, and entered into negotiations
about the Russian Protectorate of
Christian subjects in Turkey, as if that
were the sole point which had occasioned
the disturbance! What, under
such circumstances, could the Czar
conceive, but that they were playing
into his hands? He had apprised
them, in almost as many words, that
he intended to take possession of
Turkey, so that they knew perfectly
well that the question involved was
not one of religion, but of political
aggrandisement. It was, however,
his policy to make it appear to the
uninitiated that religion was his paramount
motive; and when the British
Cabinet began to negotiate and issue
notes upon that footing, he was, after
the confidential correspondence which
had taken place, fairly entitled to
believe that they were not in earnest.
The Czar is a remarkably able man—we
question whether, politically speaking,
he is not the ablest man in
Europe—but his own extraordinary
position precludes him from understanding
the effect of public opinion
in such a country as our own. He is
accustomed to deal with Cabinets,
not with nations or parliaments; and
he attributes more power to the former
than they possess, at least according
to the constitution of Great Britain.
The British Cabinet cannot, like that
of Prussia or Austria, commit the
country to a course which is inconsistent
with or derogatory to its
honour.</p>

<p class='c009'>In consequence of this irresolution
on the part of our rulers, we are now
precipitated into war, and are already
beginning to feel some of its inconveniences.
Let us now endeavour to
ascertain the causes which have led
to so very serious a denouement as
the disruption of the peace of Europe.
It is important that we should do so
now, and not leave the question entirely
to the future speculation of historians.</p>

<p class='c009'>During Lord Derby’s short tenure
of office, relations of peculiar amity
had been established between Britain
and France. Lord Malmesbury, than
whom no more able or judicious minister
ever held the seals of the Foreign
Office, saw that the interests of civilisation
not only in the west, but
throughout the whole of Europe,
could only be maintained by a close
and permanent co-operation, and mutual
good understanding between these
two countries; and he addressed himself
to the task with equal discretion
and success. It is not too much to
say that Britain and France never
were more cordially united and confidentially
allied than during the
period we refer to. This, of course,
was anything but agreeable to the
Czar, whose opportunity lay in a separation
of the interests of the two
great powers of the West.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dissolution of Lord Derby’s
Government and the accession of the
Aberdeen Ministry effected a material
alteration. The new Premier, Lord
Aberdeen, had been for a great many
years on the most intimate footing
with the despotic Courts and Cabinets.
He had not, it was true, the
ability of the Nesselrodes or Metternichs;
but he was considered in the
highest diplomatic circles as a person
who might easily be led, and upon
whom a certain show of deference
would not be thrown away. It was
supposed, also, that he regarded with
particular dislike the recent changes
in France, and was not favourable to
the re-establishment of the Empire
under the rule of Napoleon III. This
veteran ally of the despotic powers
was now associated with men whose
former political opinions had differed
greatly from his, but who were openmouthed
and unscrupulous in their
attacks upon the Emperor of the
French. We need hardly remind our
readers of the highly reprehensible
language which was employed by
Sir James Graham, and Sir Charles
Wood—both of them Cabinet Ministers—in
respect to the Emperor
Napoleon, or of the foul and scurrilous
attacks upon him with which,
about the beginning of last year,
the columns of the Liberal press
abounded. All that is changed now.
There is, indeed, plenty of invective
and abuse, but it is directed towards
another quarter. The French Emperor,
formerly pilloried by the Coalitionists,
has become the object of
their laudation. The Russian Emperor,
whom they formerly lauded, is
now put into the pillory.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such being the declared views of
the Coalitionists in regard to France,
it very naturally occurred to the Czar,
that a more favourable opportunity
could not possibly arise for detaching
Britain from the side of France, and
so rendering a future combination between
these two powers impracticable.
Accordingly, as the published correspondence
shows, he did not lose a
moment in opening his views to the
British envoy at St Petersburg:
France, as we have seen, was not to
be consulted at all regarding the disposal
of Turkey. Provided Britain
and Russia were of accord, it mattered
nothing what view might be taken
by any other European power. France
might do as she pleased, but the others
would be an overmatch for her. Here
are the expressions which the Emperor
used on the 21st February:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“His Imperial Majesty spoke of
France. ‘God forbid,’ he said, ‘that
I should accuse any one wrongfully,
but there are circumstances both at
Constantinople and Montenegro which
are extremely suspicious; it looks
very much as if the French Government
were endeavouring to embroil
us all in the East, hoping in this way
the better to arrive at their own objects,
one of which, no doubt, is the
possession of Tunis.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Emperor proceeded to say that,
for his own part, he cared very little
what line the French might think
proper to take in Eastern affairs, and
that little more than a month ago he
had apprised the Sultan that if his
assistance was required for resisting
the menaces of the French, it was
entirely at the service of the Sultan!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But for the temptation held out
by the accession of the Coalition Ministry
to power in Great Britain, it is
more than improbable that the Czar
would have made any overtures of
the kind. But at the head of that
Ministry he saw Lord Aberdeen,
“who knows me so well, who has
full confidence in me as I have in him”—the
extent of that confidence being
marked by the statement, that he was
convinced he could bring his lordship to
an understanding in the course of ten
minutes’ conversation. He had also remarked
that at least two members of the
Cabinet, in violation both of decency
and of their duty as Ministers of the
Crown, had been indulging in coarse
and unmannerly invective against the
Sovereign of France; and, as a matter
of course, he arrived at the conclusion
that they would be more ready to coalesce
with him than to ally themselves
cordially with a government which
they had spoken of in public in such unexampled
terms of contempt. In this
calculation, however, he was deceived.
Wrong-headed as Lord John Russell
is, we do not believe that he would,
for one moment, have allowed himself
to become a consenting party to such
a flagitious transaction as the partition
of Turkey; and the same thing may
be said of Lord Palmerston, whose
exclusion, through short-sighted jealousy,
from the Foreign Office at that
particular time, we must regard as a
national misfortune. But that matters
not in the consideration of the point
before us. Both circumstance and
time concur to show that it was the
accession of the Coalition Ministry to
power, and the unwarrantable language
used by some of its members
towards the Emperor of France, that
encouraged the Czar to bring forward,
and to put into shape, the project
which, no doubt, he had long entertained,
but which could not be previously
pursued for the want of a
fitting opportunity.</p>

<p class='c009'>We regard, therefore, the formation
of the Coalition Ministry in Britain
as the event which directly led
to the original overture—the hopes of
the Czar being founded upon the
political connections and understood
tendencies of Lord Aberdeen, and also
on the declared aversion of some of
his colleagues to the head of the
French Government. But for the formation
of that Ministry the designs of
Russia upon Turkey would have been
postponed.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have already commented upon
the course which was pursued by the
Ministry from the time when they
were apprized of the designs of the
Czar, down to that when the Danubian
Principalities were invaded.
We have expressed our opinion that
a serious remonstrance, coupled with
a plain intimation that Great Britain
would not permit an occupation of the
Turkish territory, would have sufficed
during the earlier part of last year,
and before any overt step was taken,
to have deterred the Czar from proceeding
with his project. We ground
that view upon the policy which has
been invariably pursued by Russia—which
is to bully and cajole, not to
fight. Let us grant that the possession
of Constantinople is the darling
project of the Czar—let us grant that,
in order to attain it, he would run
considerable risk, and submit to extraordinary
sacrifices; still we are
of opinion that had he been aware,
before utterly committing himself,
that he would be opposed by the combined
forces of Britain and France, he
never would have plunged into the
contest. See what he risks. First,
the annihilation of his fleets, both in
the Baltic and in the Black Sea, for
he can hardly hope to contend with
Britain and France upon the waters.
Next, the derangement and stoppage
of trade, so vital to the real interests
of Russia, and equivalent to a sentence
of bankruptcy against many of
her nobles and merchants, who depend
entirely upon the amount and
continuance of their exports. Then
there are the chances of insurrection
in Poland, and revolt in Finland; and
the certainty that Russia, if worsted,
will be so dismembered as to prevent
her from again disturbing the peace
of Europe. These are very serious
considerations; and we may be certain
that the Czar, great as his appetite undoubtedly
is for appropriation, would
rather have foregone his purposes
upon Turkey, than have proceeded
had he believed that the two Western
powers would be firm and united in
their resistance. Indeed, singular as
it may appear, we are about to engage
in a war for which no one country
in Europe is desirous. Britain,
with her eight hundred millions of
debt, is by no means desirous to increase
the burden of taxation, or to
imperil or impede that commerce to
which she owes so much of her greatness.
In like manner France has no
interest to go to war, for she also is
heavily burdened, and the present
Emperor has nothing so much at heart
as to restore the state of the finances.
Austria has anything but an interest
that war should take place, for in
that event, if she takes the side of
Russia, there will be immediate
insurrection both in Hungary and
Lombardy; and if she takes the other
side, she must quarrel with a very old
partner in iniquity. Prussia has no
interest, for the age of subsidies has
gone by, and she is likely to suffer to
whichever side she adheres; but most
especially if she adopts the cause of
Russia. Neutral she cannot remain.
We need not say that Turkey, the
state which is attacked, does not desire
war; and we are thoroughly convinced
that the Czar, were he not
committed so deeply, would be glad
to withdraw his pretensions. Now,
who suffered him to commit himself
so deeply? We answer, the Coalition
Ministry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Had they been of one accord among
themselves, nothing of this kind would
have happened. If Lord Aberdeen
had been sole and supreme master in
his Cabinet, it is possible that Russia
might have succeeded in acquiring a
protectorate over Turkey. The Sultan
could hardly have attempted to resist
without powerful European aid; and
France, had she found Britain lukewarm
or indifferent, could not be expected
to come forward as the defender
of the balance of power without a
single ally. No doubt, had this occurred,
it would have given Russia a
most dangerous preponderance in
Europe, and probably necessitated a
future struggle; but, in the mean time,
there would have been no war. Had
the Cabinet been under the guidance
of Palmerston or Russell, the first
advances of the Emperor, if made at
all, would have been met by a distinct
and peremptory refusal, and by a
threat which would have effectually
deterred him from moving a step
further. But unfortunately—most
unfortunately for us, and for our children,
and for the general peace of
Europe, this is <em>not</em> a united Cabinet.
It is a congregation of men holding
totally opposite opinions—bred up in
adverse schools—adhering to antagonistical
traditions—influenced by jealousy
among themselves—and unable,
upon any one important point, whether
it relates to foreign or domestic policy,
to arrive at a common conclusion.
Take the case now before us. But
for Palmerston and Russell, and their
other adherents in the Cabinet, Lord
Aberdeen might have established the
principle of non-interference between
Russia and Turkey—and there would
have been no war. But for Lord Aberdeen
and his adherents, Palmerston
and Russell might have checked the designs
and met the overtures of the Czar,
by declaring at once that they would
not suffer him to send a single soldier
across the Pruth, and that if he persisted
in his design, they would invite
the co-operation of France, and defend
Turkey to the uttermost—and
in that case also there would have
been no war. But the Cabinet was
split into two, if not three, parties;
and the adoption of a middle course,
of feeble dissuasion, unaccompanied
by any hint of ulterior consequences,
but rather couched in terms of extreme
and unworthy subserviency, deceived
the Czar, encouraged him to
proceed,—and now war is all but declared,
and our fleet is riding in the
Baltic. We have approached the
subject in anything but a party spirit—we
have perused the correspondence,
recently published, over and over
again, in the hope that we might
gather from it a justification of the
course which the British Ministry has
pursued—but we are unable to arrive
at any conclusion except this, that but
for the formation of the Coalition Cabinet,
the ambitious schemes of Russia
would not have been developed; and
that, but for its continuance and internal
divisions, those schemes would
have been effectually checked. In
plain language, had it not been
determined by a secret cabal that
Lord Derby’s Government should be
overthrown by the most extraordinary
combination of parties ever known in
this country, there would have been
no war; and it is right that the
country should know to whom they
are indebted for the burdens which
are now to be imposed upon us.</p>

<p class='c009'>We do not object to the principle
upon which the war proceeds. We
think it full time that the grasping
ambition, insidious progress, and
inordinate arrogance of Russia should
receive a check. It is to us matter of
pride and congratulation to know that,
in the coming struggle, the colours of
Britain and France will be displayed
side by side. But we detest war, for
its own sake, as fervently as any member
of the Peace Society can do, and
we are perfectly alive to the awful consequences
which it entails. What we
wish is, that the public should not
misapprehend the real cause of the
present rupture of the peace of Europe.
That it originally arose from the exorbitant
ambition of the Czar, is beyond
all question; but ambition can
be controlled, and, fortunately, the
Czar is not yet master of the universe.
Nay, he is not yet master of Europe;
for although, by spoliation and absorption,
he has secured to himself a
vast extent of territory to which he
had no patrimonial claim; and although
he exercises a great influence
over States which, in former times,
have acquired accretions by unprincipled
subserviency to his house, he
has yet to encounter the exerted power
and civilisation of the West. Had
our Cabinet been united, and true to
their trust, that encounter might have
been avoided. But it was not so.
Some of them were Russian, and
some anti-Russian in their views,
principles, and antecedents; and so,
in consequence of having a Coalition
Ministry, which, after being warned of
the designs of Russia, egregiously
bungled our finance, and left us with
a prospect of a deficit, we are to be
forced into a war of which no man can
foresee the issue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let those who shudder at the cost,
at least know to whom the cost is due.
We are now paying, and are likely
to pay for a long time to come, for
the privilege of having a Coalition
Ministry. But we submit, that the
continuance of such a form of government
is not desirable. We have
shown, in regard to foreign affairs,
and from evidence which cannot be
gainsayed, what are its results; we
could show, if space allowed us, its
results upon domestic legislation.
But we shall not enter into the lesser
topics now. We have, as yet, but
touched upon a part of the expediency
of coalition; and our deliberate conclusion
is, that to the fact of the formation
of the Coalition Ministry we
must attribute the development of
the schemes of Russia, and to its extraordinary
vacillation and want of
concert the catastrophe of a European
war.</p>

already several times mentioned, there is by the side of diplomatic negotiations
another action to exercise, and it is the attitude assumed by the Cabinet of St Petersburg
itself which has shown the necessity of it. When we knew that the army cantoned
in the south of Russia was on a war footing, that it was provisioned as on the
eve of a campaign—when the fleet at Sebastopol was ready to weigh anchor—when
considerable purchases of wood were made for throwing bridges over the Pruth and
the Danube—if all this did not indicate that hostilities were declared, it at least
showed that they were approaching, and that their commencement only depended on
a word. Who could guarantee us that, under the influence of a first movement, that
word would not be pronounced at St Petersburg, and that, if it had been, that the city
of Constantinople would be protected from a <i><span lang="fr">coup de main</span></i>? It was a danger of this
kind that we feared, and as, if it were to be realised, the game would be lost at the outset,
prudence imposed on us the duty of doing everything to prevent it. In what
could such a measure of foresight more resemble a provocation than did the armaments
of Russia herself? Why should not France and England, for the object of
maintaining the treaty of 1841, have the right of doing that which one of the Powers
which signed that convention was doing with such very different designs? Such
are the considerations which determined us to send our fleet to Salamis, and which
we now recommend to draw closer to the Dardanelles, not to take the initiative in an
aggression, not to encourage Turkey to refuse every arrangement, but to secure her
against an immediate danger, and to reserve in case of need to diplomacy the
resources which it would no longer have if it had to struggle against <i><span lang="fr">faits accomplis</span></i>.”</p>
